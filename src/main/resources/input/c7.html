<a id="Learning_Spells"></a>
<h4>Learning Spells</h4>
<p>In order to learn a spell, a player must usually find a spellbook, scroll, or trainer who has knowledge of that
	specific spell. These would normally be found in larger towns and cities, or rarely in dungeons or out in the
	wilderness. Certain spells are so widespread that they are considered common knowledge and can be learned without a
	tome. Likewise, certain class abilities such as the Warlock's eldritch tome or the scholar's codex arcana provide
	special access to arcane knowledge.
</p>
<p>Once an appropriate trainer or tome has been located, the player may have to meet certain requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A certain level of an attribute</li>
	<li>Proficiency in a certain skill</li>
	<li>Mastery of prerequisite spells</li>
	<li>A certain number of training slots</li>
	<li>A required sum of gold</li>
</ul>
<p>Each spell lists its specific requirements in its description. Once all these requirements are met, the player learns
	the spell. The spell can only be unlearned if the player intentionally forgets it, usually in order to free up
	training slots.
</p>
<h5>Spell Rarities</h5>
<p>Some spells are much more commonly used and studied than others. Spells come in four rarities, which determine how
	difficult it is to acquire knowledge, as well as how others (such as NPCs) would likely react to seeing them used.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Common</b> spells are widely known and often used for very practical applications such as healing or repair.
		These spells are usually watered-down versions of more powerful spells studied by academic institutions.
	</li>
	<li><b>Academic</b> spells are studied and taught at a university level. They are generally inaccessible to the
		population at large, usually due to the high precision and innate talent required to cast correctly.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Forbidden</b> spells are those that respectable institutions have deemed unethical or dangerous. This
		typically includes all forms of necromancy and demonolatry. Knowledge and practice of these spells is actively
		suppressed and highly illegal. If you want to learn these spells, you might have to get your hands dirty, and be
		careful where you use them.
	</li>
	<li><b>Esoteric</b> spells are not taught by universities, even at a doctoral level. All but lost to time, these
		spells are often guarded behind the bizarre initiation rituals of depraved secret societies or scattered cults.
		Learning of the existence of such a spell (let alone learning its practice) is no small feat.
	</li>

<h4>Casting Spells</h4>
<p>Once a spell has been learned, certain additional requirements must be met in order to cast the spell. These
	requirements are unique to each spell, and detailed in the spell description. In general, most spells expend AP and
	require a main hand action to cast. However, some spells require two hands, while others can be cast with the
	offhand. Spell requirements are often related to how the spell is cast, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Evocations</b>: Spells which can be cast quickly and take effect instantaneously. So named because they often
		initiated by speaking a magical word. Casting the spell incurs a one-time expenditure of AP. Most of these are
		versatile spells with few material or circumstantial requirements.
	</li>
	<li><b>Concentration Spells</b>: Spells which are cast over a span of time. These spells usually require a burst of
		AP to initiate the spell and a smaller amount to maintain it. Concentration can be broken if the caster is
		damaged or distracted.
	</li>
	<li><b>Rituals</b>: Spells that require careful and methodic preparation. These spells are not normally cast during
		combat, but usually offer a better tradeoff of AP versus power. Rituals often require specific circumstances,
		such as certain weather conditions, positioning of the moon or stars, or access to a consecrated altar.
	</li>
	<li><b>Ceremonies</b>: Ceremonies are complex rituals that require more magical energy than is available to a single
		character. During a ceremony, each participant contributes some energy towards the casting of the spell. Like
		rituals, these spells often have special requirements.
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>Targeting Spells</h5>
<p>Many spells have a range of effectiveness and target a certain area of the battlefield. Every spell has a target, of
	one of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Self</b>: The spell targets the caster of the spell only.</li>
	<li><b>Touch</b>: The spell targets one or more creatures that the spellcaster is able to physically touch.</li>
	<li><b>Range</b>: The spell affects some or all targets within a given range. The spell specifies whether the
		targets must be allies or enemies, how many may be affected. Line-of-sight to all targets is required unless
		otherwise specified.
	</li>
	<li><b>Point</b>: The spell targets a specific point within range and line-of-sight.</li>
	<li><b>Shape</b>: The spell targets a specific area within range, based on one of the shapes described below. If the
		range is zero, the shape is targeted on the caster.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Most spells that target something within a range require line-of-sight to the target. A spell can be cast on a target
	without line-of-sight only if the description explicitly says so. The caster always has line-of-sight to themselves.
</p>
<p>Spells that have a range and a target of self or a point take one of the following shapes:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Shape</th>
		<th>Effect</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sphere</td>
		<td>Affects all targets which overlap a sphere. The sphere's radius is specified by the spell.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cylinder</td>
		<td>Affects all targets which overlap a vertical cylinder. The cylinder's radius and height are specified by the
			spell.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cone</td>
		<td>Affects all targets which overlap a horizontal cone, with the tip at the point of origination. The cone's
			length is specified by the spell. Its angle defaults to 45 if not specified.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Line</td>
		<td>Affects all targets in the path of the line. The length is specified by the spell. The width defaults to 1
			if not otherwise specified. If the spell target is self, then one of the line endpoints ends on the caster's
			tile. The caster decides if the spell includes their tile or not.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cube</td>
		<td>Affects all targets within a cube. The edge length of the cube is specified by the spell. The cube is
			centered on the point of origination if not otherwise specified.
		</td>
	</tr>

<h4>Schools of Sorcery</h4>
<blockquote>Any sensible treatise on magic will disclose the following insight: <i>magic is energy</i>. Therefore, magic
	is classified according to whence this energy originates, the techniques used to manipulate it, and finally
	according to the overall purpose of its application. In fact, all spells follow the same basic pattern, whereby the
	magus identifies a source of energy, imposes order over chaos, and finally unleashes this directed energy upon the
	world. These stages are formally known as sorcery, concentration, and enactment.
	<p style="text-align: right;">â€” Albrecht Riftenvorg, <i>A Primer on Magic</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being intensely studied, magic remains an abstruse and opaque subject. Among those who study it, there is no
	consensus as to why certain individuals wield its power so effortlessly, why certain spells are so difficult to
	reproduce, and why other spells work at all. This inconvenience doesn't stop scholars from doing the one thing they
	are truly good at, however: categorizing things.
</p>
<p>A long time ago, spells were categorized into two types: thaumaturgy and divination. Spells and spell schools ending
	in -urgy belonged to the former category, while spells ending in -mancy belonged to the latter. For example, there
	was once a distinction between necromancy and necromurgy; the former was concerned with contacting deceased spirits,
	while the latter was concerned with raising their bodies. However, centuries of expanding magical theory as well as
	a good deal of linguistic bastardization have relegated such distinction to a mere footnote.
</p>
<p>In modern times, magic is roughly divided into eight categories, formally known as <i>schools of sorcery</i>.
	Although scholars categorize by their primary energetic sources, some spells arguably belong to more than one
	category, while others scarcely fit into any discipline. The eight schools are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Alchemy</b>: The study of magical solvents, potions, and elixirs. Healing and transmutation are the end
		result. The practice is tedious, and impenetrable to all but those of exceptional intelligence.
	</li>
	<li><b>Astrology</b>: The study of magic sourced from the heavenly spheres. Such magic is often channeled for the
		purposes of divination or protection. A mage excels in this discipline chiefly by virtue of his intelligence.
	</li>
	<li><b>Biomancy</b>: The magic of living things, the wild, and the human body. Also known as natural or primal
		magic. Commonly used for healing, and enhancements or transformations of the physical body. This school opens
		itself most deeply to those with open hearts, pure intentions, and strong willpower.
	</li>
	<li><b>Elementurgy</b>: School concerned with application of alchemical elements for destructive purposes. Includes
		disciplines such as pyromancy, cryomancy, and electromancy. The spells in this school are equal parts
		devastating and spectacular, but require strong willpower to master.
	</li>
	<li><b>Conjuration</b>: The magic of higher beings, including theurgy, feyseeking, dragonolatry, and demonolatry.
		Those possessing high charisma tend to excel in attracting and entreating such spirits.
	</li>
	<li><b>Enchantment</b>: The study of transferring magical energy to and from physical objects. Includes disciplines
		such as infusion, disenchantment, and crystallurgy. All enchanted objects such as magical swords and armor are
		the result of workings of spells from the enchantment school. Excellence requires intelligence, first and
		foremost.
	</li>
	<li><b>Psionics</b>: The magic of the psyche, whether used for telekinesis, telepathy, hypnosis, or illusion. Most
		easily mastered by those possessing energetic charisma.
	</li>
	<li><b>Necromancy</b>: The forbidden study of reanimating the dead or drawing energy from the souls of the departed.
		The practice is iniquitous, but it is known that those possessing great willpower excel in this depraved art.
	</li>
</ul>
