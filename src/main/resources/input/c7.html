<a id="Learning_Spells"></a><h4>Learning Spells</h4>
<p>In order to learn a spell, a player must usually find a spellbook, scroll, or trainer who has knowledge of that
	specific spell. These would normally be found in larger towns and cities, or rarely in dungeons or out in the
	wilderness. Certain spells are so widespread as to be considered common knowledge, and can be learned without a
	tome. Likewise, certain class abilities such as the Warlock's eldritch tome or the scholar's codex arcana provide
	special access to arcane knowledge.
</p>
<p>Once an appropriate trainer or tome has been located, the player may have to meet certain requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A certain level of an attribute</li>
	<li>Proficiency in a certain skill</li>
	<li>Mastery of prerequisite spells</li>
	<li>A certain number of training slots</li>
	<li>A required sum of gold</li>
</ul>
<p>Each spell lists its specific requirements in its description. Once all these requirements are met, the player learns
	the spell. The spell can only be unlearned if the player intentionally forgets it, usually in order to free up
	training slots.
</p>
<h5>Spell Rarities</h5>
<p>Some spells are much more commonly used and studied than others. Spells come in four rarities, which determine how
	difficult it is to acquire knowledge, as well as how others (such as NPCs) would likely react to seeing them used.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Common</b> spells are widely known and often used for very practical applications such as healing or repair.
		These spells are usually simplified incantations and rituals based on more powerful versions formally studied by
		academic institutions.
	</li>
	<li><b>Scholastic</b> spells are studied and taught at a university level. They are generally inaccessible to the
		population at large, usually due to the high precision and innate talent required to cast correctly.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Forbidden</b> spells are those deemed unethical by official institutions and public consensus. Includes all
		forms of necromancy and demonolatry. Knowledge of these spells is actively suppressed and practice of such
		spells is usually illegal. If you want to learn these spells, you might have to get your hands dirty.
	</li>
	<li><b>Esoteric</b> spells are not taught openly by universities, even at a doctoral level. Often the knowledge of
		even the existence of such spells is suppressed by the scattered cults and secret societies that practice them.
		Many spells of this sort are questionably ethical, but are so little known that their practice does not arouse
		suspicion.
	</li>
</ul>
<a id="Casting_Spells"></a><h4>Casting Spells</h4>
<p>Once a spell has been learned, certain additional requirements must be met in order to cast the spell. These
	requirements are unique to each spell, and detailed in the spell description. In general, most spells expend AP and
	require a main hand action to cast. However, some spells require two hands, while others can be cast with the
	offhand. Spell requirements are often related to how the spell is cast, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Evocations</b>: Spells which can be cast quickly and take effect instantaneously. Often initiated by speaking
		a magical word. Casting the spell incurs a one-time expenditure of AP. Most of these are versatile spells with
		few material or circumstantial requirements.
	</li>
	<li><b>Concentration Spells</b>: Spells which are cast over a span of time. These spells usually require a burst of
		AP to initiate the spell and a smaller amount to maintain it. Concentration can be broken if the caster is
		damaged or distracted.
	</li>
	<li><b>Rituals</b>: Spells that require careful and methodic preparation. These spells are not normally cast during
		combat, but usually offer a better tradeoff of AP versus power. Rituals often require specific circumstances,
		such as certain weather conditions, positioning of the moon or stars, or access to a consecrated altar.
	</li>
	<li><b>Ceremonies</b>: Ceremonies are complex rituals that require more magical energy than is available to a single
		character. During a ceremony, each participant contributes some energy towards the casting of the spell. Like
		rituals, these spells often have special requirements.
	</li>
</ul>
<a id="Schools_of_Sorcery"></a><h4>Schools of Sorcery</h4>
<blockquote>Any sensible treatise on magic will disclose the following insight: <i>magic is energy</i>. Therefore, magic
	is classified according to whence this energy originates, the techniques used to manipulate it, and finally
	according to the overall purpose of its application. In fact, all spells follow the same basic pattern, whereby the
	magus identifies a source of energy, imposes order over chaos, and finally unleashes this directed energy upon the
	world. These stages are formally known as sorcery, concentration, and enactment.
	<p style="text-align: right;">â€” Albrecht Riftenvorg, <i>A Primer on Magic</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being intensely studied, magic remains an abstruse and opaque subject. Among those who study it, there is no
	consensus as to why certain individuals wield its power so effortlessly, why certain spells are so difficult to
	reproduce, and why other spells work at all. This inconvenience doesn't stop scholars from doing the one thing they
	are truly good at, however: categorizing things.
</p>
<p>A long time ago, spells were categorized into two types: thaumaturgy and divination. Spells and spell schools ending
	in -urgy belonged to the former category, while spells ending in -mancy belonged to the latter. For example, there
	was once a distinction between necromancy and necromurgy; the former was concerned with contacting deceased spirits,
	while the latter was concerned with raising their bodies. However, centuries of expanding magical theory as well as
	a good deal of linguistic bastardization have relegated such distinction to a mere footnote.
</p>
<p>In modern times, magic is roughly divided into eight categories, formally known as <i>schools of sorcery</i>.
	Although scholars categorize by their primary energetic sources, some spells arguably belong to more than one
	category, while others scarcely fit into any discipline. The eight schools are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Alchemy</b>: The study of magical solvents, potions, and elixirs. Healing and transmutation are the end
		result. The practice is tedious, and impenetrable to all but those of exceptional intelligence.
	</li>
	<li><b>Astrology</b>: The study of magic sourced from the heavenly spheres. Such magic is often channeled for the
		purposes of divination or protection. A mage excels in this discipline chiefly by virtue of his intelligence.
	</li>
	<li><b>Biomancy</b>: The magic of living things, the wild, and the human body. Commonly used for healing, and
		enhancements or transformations of the physical body. This school opens itself most deeply to those with open
		hearts, pure intentions, and strong willpower.
	</li>
	<li><b>Elementurgy</b>: School concerned with application of alchemical elements for destructive purposes. Includes
		disciplines such as pyromancy, cryomancy, and electromancy. The spells in this school are immensely satisfying
		to perform, but require exceptional willpower to fully master.
	</li>
	<li><b>Conjuration</b>: The magic of higher beings, including theurgy, feyseeking, dragonolatry, and demonolatry.
		Those possessing high charisma tend to excel in attracting and entreating such spirits.
	</li>
	<li><b>Enchantment</b>: The study of transferring magical energy to and from physical objects. Includes disciplines
		such as infusion, disenchantment, and crystallurgy. All enchanted objects such as magical swords and armor are
		the result of workings of spells from the enchantment school. Excellence requires intelligence, first and
		foremost.
	</li>
	<li><b>Psionics</b>: The magic of the psyche, whether used for illusion, hypnosis, or telekinesis. Most easily
		mastered by those possessing exceptional charisma.
	</li>
	<li><b>Necromancy</b>: The forbidden study of reanimating the dead or drawing energy from the souls of the departed.
		The practice is iniquitous, but it is known that those possessing great willpower excel in this depraved art.
	</li>
