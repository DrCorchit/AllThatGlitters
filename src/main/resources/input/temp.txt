Stellar
    1|Lodestone|Evocation|A trail of ghostly lights appear, guiding you to a location you have visited before and is no further than ten miles away. The lights last for one hour, and can be seen by allies and enemies. The lights appear as you approach them and disappear as you leave them behind.
    1|Sunbeam|Evocation|Deal 1d8 {{damage.holy}} damage to an enemy. If cast upon an ally (but not undead or an automaton) heal it by that amount instead.
    2|Luminance|Enchantment|An item you choose begins to glow with a gentle blue or yellow aura. You may combine this enchantment with a divination spell (by casting both at the same time) to make the aura only appear when some condition is met.
    3|Solstice|Concentration|A beam of healing sunlight shines down on a chosen area and remains for duration of the spell. Within the spell's effect radius, allies gain 1d6 healing, while enemies take 1d6 holy damage. This effect is applied when the spell is cast, and again at the start of the caster's turn. TODO: radius
    4|Starlight|Concentration|Illuminate an area (no larger than an acre) with a soft blue celestial light. The light is only visible to you and your allies. Living creatures illuminated by this light glow brightly, but not the undead or automatons.
    5|Aurora|Concentration|A spectral halo of prismatic light circles the head of an ally you choose. For every turn concentration is maintained, they heal 1d6 hitpoints per turn and deal 1d6 bonus radiant damage with their melee attacks. In addition, they cannot be {{status.blinded}} by magical effects.
    7|Soul Equinox|Evocation|A mote of light damages an enemy for 10 radiant damage and then heals an ally by 10. If the enemy succeeds a DT 10 {{attr.DEX}} saving throw, the damage and healing are reduced by half.
    9|Solar Laser|Evocation|A beam of light brighter than the sun issues forth from your hands and burns all in its path. All creatures caught in the path of the light must pass a DT 15 {{attr.mobility}} check or take 2d20 {{damage.holy}} damage and become {{status.blinded}} for 1d4 turns. Creatures that make their save take half damage and are not blinded.
Lunar
    1|Ray of Lunacy|Evocation|A dark violet ray issues forth from your extended creature, directed towards the forehead of the chosen creature. That creature must succeed a DT 12 {{attr.CHA}} saving throw or be driven {{status.mad}} and {{status.blind}} for 1d4 turns.
    2|Moonshadow|Concentration|A circular shadow appears on the ground, encircled by ghastly violet flames. Entities stepping inside the circle are {{status.blinded}} and take 1d6 damage per turn.
    3|Lesser Invisibility|Evocation|You or a target you can touch gains {{status.epehemeral_invisibility}} for 10 minutes.
    3|Time Stream|Evocation|Time accelerates for you or a target you touch, allowing the target to take twice as many actions per turn for 2 turns. From the target's perspective, the world appears to be unfolding in slow motion for around twenty seconds.
    5|Time Void|Evocation|An object or entity disappears into a dark void where no time passes for 1d4 turns. When the spell ends, the object returns to the same spot, unchanged, as if no time had passed during that interval.
    7|Time Rift|Concentration|The spell creates a sphere with an eight-foot radius around the caster. Within the sphere, time appears to proceed at a normal rate, and time outside the sphere appears to be accelerated by a factor of ten. Living creatures which pass through the sphere take 3d8 true damage, due to the effects of time compression (or decompression) on their internal organs.
    8|Greater Invisibility|Concentration|You or a target you touch gains {{status.invisibility}} for 1 hour.
    9|Mass Invisibility|Ceremony|You and all ceremonial participants gain {{status.invisibility}} for 24 hours.
    10|Phantasm|Concentration|The caster's physical form fades, still visible to the eye but noticeably transparent. Fire and blade find no purchase against them, passing through the body as through empty air. The caster gains the {{status.levitated}} status and may not move without levitation, but may pass through ground and walls should they do so. If the target is partially inside physical matter when the spell ends, they are pushed away. If wholly inside, death is instantaneous and certain.
  Planetary
    1|Meteorite|Evocation|A meteorite slams into the ground, striking a chosen location. The meteorite deals 1d8 {{damage.bludgeoning}} damage to its target and 1d4 {{damage.force}} damage to creatures within 6 feet. If the target makes a DT 11 {{attr.DEX}} saving throw, it does not take bludgeoning damage.
    2|Gravity Slam|Concentration|The spell caster chooses a target within range. As long as concentration is maintained, the target ceases to be effected by gravity and hovers a few feet above the ground. The caster can choose to end concentration, overwhelming the target with residual gravity and slamming them into the ground. The target taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage for every turn concentration was maintained. If concentration was broken (or the caster chooses) the spell ends without slamming the target into the ground.
    3|Levitation|Concentration|The caster hovers roughly 3 feet above the ground, gliding above the terrain. They gain the {{status.levitated}} status and their {{attr.SPD}} increases to 20. If the ground is more than 3 feet below, they descend slowly and gracefully.
    5|Misty Step|Evocation|Teleport to a location you can see, within 300 feet.
    6|Great Comet|Evocation|A comet burning with pure white flame issues forth from the caster's outstretched hands. Dodge and weave as it may, the comet tracks the target around corners and over obstacles to (almost surely) strike true. The caster rolls for {{skills.accuracy}} against the target, but the target's dodge chance is reduced by half. On a hit, the comet deals 1d8 bludgeoning and 1d8 radiant damage.
    7|Teleportation|Evocation|Transport yourself or a target you touch to a location you have visited before. If the target is unwilling, they may attempt a DT 8 {{attr.NST}} saving throw to resist being teleported.
    8|Meteor Shower|Evocation|A storm of meteors plummets from the sky, towards random locations near a chosen point. Targets within range take 2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8 {{damage.force}} damage. Each target that passes a DT 12 {{attr.DEX}} save takes no bludgeoning damage.
    9|Mass Teleportation|Ceremony|When the ceremony is completed, all participants are teleported to a location up to 10 miles away. Each additional participant increases the cost of the spell by 15, but also increases the teleportation range by 5 miles.
    10|Stargate|Ceremony|Two parties working in tandem perform corresponding ceremonies in two different locations. After confirming appropriate astrological alignment, the two groups (typically working via psychic connection) gather around a circle and perform a complex ceremony involving specific incantations. When the ceremony is complete, a permanent astral gate appears in that location, linked to the corresponding gate constructed by the cooperating party. The portal remains open indefinitely, unless another ceremony is convened to banish it.

  Weal
    1|Herbal Remedy|Evocation|The caster heals themselves and a target they touch for 1d6 damage. The caster must be able to touch another living creature in order to heal themselves with this spell.
    1|Shillelagh|Evocation|Any wooden weapons (such as a club or quarterstaff) wielded by the caster becomes imbued with the power of nature. While active, the caster may add their {{skills.nature}} proficiency bonus to the weapon's damage. In addition, they may use the nature skill to make attack rolls with the weapon, instead of {{skills.martial_arts}}.
    2|Barkskin|Concentration|The caster's skin gradually gains a thick covering resembling the bark of a tree. Their BC increases by 2 each turn concentration is maintained, up to a maximum of 10.
    2|Thorn Whip|Evocation|The caster lashes out with the power of thorns, coiling around the target and dragging them 5 feet towards the caster. The target takes 2d6 piercing damage and is dragged up to 10 feet towards the caster. If the target makes a DT 10 {{attr.STR}} saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not dragged.
    3|Aromatherapy|Ritual|Soothed by the scent of magical incense, the party heals 2d6 damage during the ritual.
    4|Tree Speech|Ritual|Placing their hands on a tree, the caster gains the ability to converse with a forest. Trees bear a timeless wisdom, and are able to communicate with other trees via their roots. Trees cannot see or speak (to humans) but they can distinguish animals, humans, and intruders within the limits of their root network.
    5|Chaos Spores|A cloud of spores coalesces around a point chosen by the caster. Targets within must make a {{attr.NST}} saving throw or suffer one of the following effects: <ol><li>{{status.blinded}}</li><li>{{status.dazed}}</li><li>{{status.madness}}</li><li>{{status.terrified}}</li></ol>
    6|Poison Spores|Evocation|A cloud of poisonous spores condenses on the target, implanting them with fungal growth. The spell cannot be mitigated, and inflicts 3 poison damage. The damage increases by 3 every time it is cast on the same target. Spore buildup is removed if the target is set aflame.
    6|Thorn Bed|Evocation|An area designated by the caster becomes thickly overgrown with thorns, becoming difficult terrain. Targets affected take 1d4 piercing damage immediately and an additional 1d4 piercing damage whenever they move through the terrain.
    8|Tree of Life|Evocation|A magical tree appears, healing all living creatures in range by 3d6 each turn, at the start of their turn. The tree has 100 hitpoints, but is vulnerable to {{damage.heat}} and {{damage.poison}} damage. The tree's healing decreases to 2d6 below 70 hp and to 1d6 below 40 hp.
    9|Become Tree|Ritual|The caster gradually transforms themselves into a tree. In so doing, they lose the ability to speak or see, but retain their knowledge, memories and personality. In addition, they may communicate with nearby trees and their lifespan is increased by 1d6 millennia.
  Fauna
    1|Spiderweb|Evocation|A gout of sticky webbing shoots from the caster's outstretched hands. The target must make a DT 14 {{skills.mobility}} saving throw or become {{status.ensnared}}, unable to move.
    1|Snakebite|Evocation|The appearance of a serpent lashes out from the caster's outstretched hand, striking towards a target up to 12 feet away. The caster makes a {{skills.nature}} check against the target's mitigation. If successful, the target takes 1d12 {{damage.poison}} damage.
    1|Cat's Eye|Evocation|The target gains the ability to see in the dark, seeing in pitch blackness as if it were dim light, and in dim light as if it were bright light.
    2|Fish's lung|Evocation|The caster gains the ability to breathe water for 1 hour.
    3|Eagle's Talons|Ritual|The caster's hands temporarily grow sharp talons, increasing their unarmed melee damage by 1d6 plus their {{skills.nature}} proficiency in {{damage.piercing}} damage. In addition, they gain advantage on grappling checks.
    3|Hawk's Eyes|Evocation|For one hour, gain advantage on perception checks. You see objects clearly, up to a distance of 10 miles.
    4|Raven's Wings|Evocation|Feathered wings sprout from your back, imbuing you with the ability to fly. The coloration and shape of the wings is unique to each caster, often a reflection of their underlying personality. Casting this spell for the first time is often treated as a coming-of-age ritual in druid circles.
    5|Lacerate|Evocation|You make a horizontal slashing motion with your hands, causing a large spectral paw to slice their air with its claws. Enemies lined up horizontally in front of you must make a {{attr.STR}} saving throw or take 2d12 {{damage.slashing}} damage. On a successful save, they take half damage.
    6|Owl's Wisdom|Ritual|The caster's {{attr.INT}} increases by 1d8 for 8 hours.
    7|Rhino's Hide|Evocation|If not wearing armor, the caster's skin becomes as tough as a Rhinoceros, increasing their BC by 8 for 5 turns. They also gain resistance to {{damage.acid}}, {damage.lightning}} and {{damage.heat}} damage.
    9|Circle of Life|Evocation|The caster takes 2d6 damage, but the target is healed for thrice that amount. If the caster falls unconscious as a result of casting this spell, the target is healed completely.
  Fey
     1|Fairy Fire|Evocation|The caster designates an area, causing the ground to glow and sparkle with eerie fey fire. Enemies entering this area become illuminated and outlined in green, blue, teal, or violet light. Melee or ranged attacks against such enemies have advantage, unless the attacker is blinded or the target is invisible.
     1|Beast Speech|Ritual|The caster gains the ability to speak with animals. Animals know quite a few things and, besides, can be persuaded to fight alongside the caster after passing a DT 15 persuasion check.
     2|Water Walking|Evocation|For one hour, the caster gains the ability to walk on water as if it were solid ground. When the spell is about to expire, the water's surface betakes a spongy and soft texture, as if it were thick mud or bedding. If cast while the mage is partially submerged, the spell propels the mage to the surface of the water. If fully underwater, the spell has no effect.
     2|Spirit Animal|Ritual|The caster enters a deep trance and meets their spirit animal, a spirit wise in the ways of the wild. TODO
     3|Far Whisper|Evocation|You gain the ability to whisper to distant creatures as if they were near. You may whisper or speak to a creature up to a mile away, and they will hear your voice as if they were standing beside you.
     4|Illusory Terrain|Ceremony|The caster beseeches the appropriate fairy council to disguise a large swathe of terrain in an appropriate manner. The fairies must be convinced that it is in their benefit to do so, though (being fey) they rarely say no to a sufficiently clever prank. If the player passes a DT 16 {{skills.persuasion}} check, the terrain appears transformed for 1d8 days, after which time the fey grow bored and cease the illusion. The illusion can be detected by anyone who draws close and
     5|Awaken Beastie|Evocation|A beast is permanently awakened to sentience, gaining +3 to {{attr.INT}} and +3 to {{attr.CHA}} in addition to the ability to speak. It automatically joins you in combat, unless mortally afraid. After one week of sentience, the animal must make a DT 14 {{attr.INT}} saving throw or be overcome with existential angst, whereupon it will plead the caster to revoke sentience (which is done by casting the spell a second time).
     5|Oneiromancy|Ritual|During the ritual, the caster beseeches the fey for a vision concerning an important topic, and then falls into a magical slumber. While asleep, the caster receives a vision. The DM privately rolls a d20, which determines how directly the vision answers the question. On a 1, the vision (fantastical as it may be) bears absolutely no relation to the question at hand, and may even be malicious fey trickery.
     6|Sweet Dreams|Ceremony|You and all participants call out to the fey, thanking them for their role in maintaining the balance of nature and protecting the life force. You invite them to visit you in your dreams, calling for succor, entertainment, and guidance. All participants roll a 1d4, and gain an effect accordingly: <ol><li>Hellish Nightmares: Tormented by cruel fey, no rest can be had. No Willpower is recovered during the long rest.</li><li>Vivid Visions: Playful and adventurous fey take the dreamer on wondrous adventures seeming to last for many days. Upon awakening, the individual gains 1d4 temporary AP.</li><li>Quiet Quandaries: The dreamer awakens beside a pool of water, which idly asks the dreamer a question. After it has been answered, it invites the dreamer to ask a question of their own. If the adventurer answered the water's question truthfully, it answers truthfully. Also gain 1d6 temporary WP.</li><li>Allmother's Embrace: The dreamers is escorted by powerful fey to the magical heart of the forest. They are greeted by a gentle yet powerful dryad called the Allmother, who embraces them tenderly. Gain 1d8 temporary HP and AP.</li></ol>
     7|Forest Defender|Ritual|An allied animal (recruited via {{spells.beast_speech}} or {{spells.awaken_beastie}}) grows to twice its normal size. Such a creature gains +10 {{attr.STR}}.
