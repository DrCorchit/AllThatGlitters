After confirming appropriate astrological alignment, the two groups (typically working via psychic connection) gather around a circle and perform a complex ceremony involving specific incantations. When the ceremony is complete, a permanent astral gate appears in that location, linked to the corresponding gate constructed by the cooperating party. The portal remains open indefinitely, unless another ceremony is convened to banish it.",
