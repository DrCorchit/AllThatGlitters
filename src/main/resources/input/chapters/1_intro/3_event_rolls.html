<p>An event roll happens when the DM determines that the outcome of some player's action depends on chance, usually
  related to the capabilities of their character. To perform an event roll, the DM first determines which aspect of the
  character will be tested, usually an attribute or a skill. An attribute check tests the raw abilities of a character,
  such as moving a heavy statue or sprinting quickly, while a skill check tests more applied abilities which may be
  improved through training, such as aiming a bow or haggling with a merchant.
</p>
<p>The DM then asks the player to roll for that skill, while privately determining a difficulty threshold (DT) typically
  ranging from 1 to 20. In response, the player rolls a d20 and adds their associated attribute score modifier. If the
  sum is greater than or equal to the DT, the character’s action succeeds.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, an event roll determines whether the player can successfully react to and mitigate an impending disaster,
  rather than proactively accomplishing some feat. This type of event roll is often called a <i>saving throw</i>, but is
  otherwise treated the same as an ordinary event roll.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: By tradition, rolling a 1 on a d20 is called a critical fail and results in an
  unusually bad outcome. Conversely, rolling a 20 is called a natural 20 and usually results in instant success.
</p>
<p>If an event roll should have more than one potential outcome, the DM can add additional DT. For example, if the
  player is attempting to treat a wound, they may be asked to roll for medicine. The DM may decide that passing DT 12
  indicates that the player is able to fully clean the wound and stanch the bleeding. Below 12 but above 6, and the
  wound is treated but later develops an infection. In any case, the DM does not usually disclose what the difficulty
  threshold(s) are—only the outcome.
</p>
<p>After the event roll is complete, the DM describes what has changed or transpired, returning to the narration phase
  and completing the cycle.</p>
