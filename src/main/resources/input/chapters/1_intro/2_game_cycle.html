<p>The game cycles between three states: narration, questioning, and action. During narration, the DM describes a
  situation, scene, or setting. At some point, the DM introduces one or more hooks that invite player interaction. For
  example, a suspicious NPC, a quest board at a tavern, a hallway branching into several mysterious passages, or even a
  crime being comitted.
</p>
<p>Questioning happens after narration is complete, but before player have decided how they wish to respond. Players are
  usually trying to visualize the scene, probe for clues or hooks, or ask questions pertinent to their planned actions.
</p>
<p>Once questioning is complete, the game moves into the action phase as the players tell the DM what they do.
  Sometimes, the DM simply narrates the outcome of these actions, completing the cycle. Other times, the action phase
  continues as the DM initiates either an event roll or a combat sequence.
