<p>Throughout the handbook, several abbreviations are used to keep the text reasonably concise. Most of these are
  explained in more detail in <a href="c3.html">chapter 3</a>. These are the most common:
</p>
<p>Combat:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HP: Health Points</li>
  <li>WP: Willpower</li>
  <li>BC: Block Chance</li>
  <li>DC: Dodge Chance</li>
  <li>MIT: Mitigation (Similar to Armor Class)</li>
  <li>CT: Critical Threshold</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: DC can easily be confused with difficulty class, which is used in other games and
  often abbreviated DC. Difficulty class is not used in this game, but expresses the same concept as difficulty
  threshold (DT).
