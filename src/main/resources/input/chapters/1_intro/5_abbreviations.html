<p>Throughout the handbook, several abbreviations are used to keep the text reasonably concise. Most of these are
  explained in more detail in <a href="c3.html">chapter 3</a>. These are the most common:
</p>
<p>Combat:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HP: Health Points (Used to determine when characters fall unconscious from their wounds.)</li>
  <li>WP: Willpower (Expended when using powerful abilities.)</li>
  <li>BC: Block Chance (The chance that an attack is mitigated by armor or shields.)</li>
  <li>DC: Dodge Chance (The chance that an attack misses a character entirely.)</li>
  <li>MIT: Mitigation (Determines how likely an attack against a character is to be effective. Similar to Armor
    Class.)
  </li>
  <li>CT: Critical Threshold (The value on the d20 required to roll a critical. Starts at 20.)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: DC can easily be confused with difficulty class, which is used in other games and
  often abbreviated DC. Difficulty Class is called "Difficulty Threshold" in <i>All That Glitters</i>.
