<p>Once you have a group of friends and a DM, you should have a session zero. Session zero doesn’t have to be in-person;
  it can be a few text messages exchanged over the course of a few days. What matters is that everyone voices their
  expectations and ensures that they are compatible with their group before the first session.
</p>
<p>Here are some important questions to discuss:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>What type of game do you want to play?</b><br/>Does your group want a lot of combat, a lot of story, or a mix
    of both? Do they want a main quest with a primary villain, or a sandbox world with a lot sidequests? Are problems
    like bandits in the countryside or necromancer cults part of an oncoming apocalypse, or merely business-as-usual?
    Having a single epic main quest can be fun, but the constant urgency tends to reduce player freedom. On the other
    hand, sandbox campaigns may feel unfocused and purposeless.
  </li>
  <li><b>Can player characters permanently die?</b><br/>Discuss player character death and total party kill (TPK)
    expectations. Are either of these outcomes possible? On the one hand, it can be heartbreaking to part with a beloved
    character. On the other hand, the possibility of player death leads to some extremely high stakes. Having the story
    end on a TPK is a very sour note; I think it is better for circumstances to intervene. However, having the
    possibility of true defeat does increase the authenticity of the threats.
  </li>
  <li><b>How do your characters meet?</b><br/>A tavern meeting is tried-and-true, but there are other options. Perhaps
    they’ve been enlisted by a local lord, jarl, or ealdorman to pursue some quest. Or maybe they've recently escaped
    from prison together, in which case one wonders whether they were falsely convicted, or are true scoundrels. Another
    possibility is that they were abducted and have awakened inside a labyrinth or cultist lair. Also, are any of the
    party natives to the starting area, or are they all foreigners? Can the players choose any race they want from the
    standard races list, or does the DM wish to create custom races to match a specific setting?
  </li>
  <li><b>What is the tone of the story?</b><br/>Do you want the story to be comedic, epic, grimdark, or realistic? How
    comfortable is your group with fantasy violence, sexuality, or politics? Oftentimes racism and sexism can make
    unsavory characters more compelling, but they may make some people in the group uncomfortable. Likewise, excessive
    humor at the wrong moments can ruin heart pounding moments of tension or suffocating dread.
  </li>
  <li><b>Are there any other concerns?</b><br/>For example, is player-versus-player combat allowed? (Not recommended.)
    Is this everyone’s first time playing the game, or is this a group of experienced players? Do you want to start at
    level 1, or higher?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Once your group answers these questions, you’re ready to make your characters and start playing the game. Remember
  that most of these questions don’t have wrong answers—you can play whatever game you want to play.
