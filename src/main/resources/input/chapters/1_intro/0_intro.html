<p>All That Glitters, like any tabletop roleplaying system, has three parts: The players, the storyteller, and the
  rulebook. Each part has a duty:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The players should understand the abilities of their characters and avoid cheating or metagaming. They should
      also respect everyone at the table and give the storyteller feedback so that problems don’t arise out of the blue.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The storyteller should create a compelling setting, characters, and story. They should create tension and
      introduce challenging combat encounters while also avoiding favoritism and respecting player agency.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rulebook should provide a framework where players can reason about the outcome of their actions and see their
      characters progressing in potency. It should assist the storyteller in creating combat encounters that are
      both unique and appropriately difficult. It may also give the storyteller guidelines for expanding
      the game system.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to play the game, you need a group of people who are willing to meet on a semi-regular basis for about 3-4
  hours. You also need someone to run the game: the storyteller. From now on, we'll refer to the storyteller as the
  dungeon master, or DM. If you’re reading this and you don’t know who your DM is, it’s probably you. <i>Be the DM you
    wish to see in the world.</i></p>
