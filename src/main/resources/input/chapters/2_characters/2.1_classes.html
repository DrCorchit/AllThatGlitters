		<p>A character's combat class gives you an idea of both their fighting style and occupational background.
			Realtistically, these two are rarely separate. Unless you're an aristocrat, you don't have the time and
			money to aquire skills of little use within your day-to-day life. So, a monk picks up his staff, or a
			veteran takes his sword from the mantlepiece, or else a scholar gathers her books. Each of them takes
			something familiar to them and does something extraordinary with it—and it all begins by embarking on an
			adventure!
		</p>
		<p>The easiest way to choose a class is to avoid all the details and just pick one that sounds cool. However, if
			you're of a mind to make an informed decision by carefully examine the unique features of each class, you
			certainly can! There are no wrong choices, only interesting ones.
		</p>
		<p>There is some ongoing debate as to the ideal number of classes in a TTRPG system. Too few classes, and
			players are less likely to find one that really captures their interest and vision. Too many, and the player
			is at risk of being drowned by excess choices—which may not be well balanced, either! I’ve decided to use 20
			classes, which are grouped into five categories, listed below. Players who struggle to pick a class can thus
			choose between one of these five categories and then choose between one of the four classes within that
			category. Hopefully it is easier to make two simple choices than one complicated choice.
