<p>In addition to each category’s attribute and proficiency bonus, each class category has a special bonus ability
	shared between all characters in that category. Here’s what each ability does:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Heavy Attack</b>: When making a strength-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 AP to increase the damage of
		your attack. If it hits, you may roll your weapon's damage die a second time and add its value to the total
		damage for the attack.
	</li>
	<li><b>Mana Regeneration</b>: When starting a combat turn with less than two AP, gain one ability point.</li>
	<li><b>Precision Strike</b>: When making a dexterity-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 AP to gain +3 to hit on
		the attack roll and lower the critical threshold by 1. (i.e. from 20 to 19, typically.)
	</li>
	<li><b>Beast Speech</b>: You know the language of beasts, and may converse with them at any time. Once a day, you
		may expend 5 AP to attempt a persuasion check to convince an animal to fight by your side for 1 hour. The
		difficulty of the check depends on the type of animal being recruited.
	</li>
	<li><b>Meditation</b>: Once per long rest and while outside of combat, you may expend 5 AP to meditate or pray to
		your deity. You may increase an attribute of your choice by 2 for one hour, not exceeding the hard cap.
	</li>
</ul>
<p> In addition to these bonuses, the proficiency bonus of the base skill for each category advances to the next level
	at level 5 and again at level 10. This bonus cannot increase the proficiency bonus beyond mastery.
