  "name": "Warg",
  "description": "A warg is someone—often an isolated hermit or cultist—who has developed the ability to transform at will into a particular animal. Unlike a druid who can transform into a wide variety of small animals, a warg can only transform into one type of animal. But what wargs sacrifice in flexibilty, they gain in power. Wargs are known for transforming into mighty animals such as the direwolf, rune bear, lions, and even the mighty rhinoceros.",
