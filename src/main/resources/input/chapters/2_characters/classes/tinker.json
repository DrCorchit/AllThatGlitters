  "description": "Deep in his workshop, the tinker sits hunched over a table full of parts. The sound of clanking and rattling is heard as he searches for this cog, that corkscrew, or a metal shaft. The moon rises high as he works through the dead of night. Perhaps by dawn he emerges, perhaps not. When he does, he is bearing some bizarre contraption. With the winding of a screw, it springs to “life”, another work of eccentric genius. This is the way of a tinker.",
