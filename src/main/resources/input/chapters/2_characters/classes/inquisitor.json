  "description": "Often clad in black armor and concealed beneath a dark hood or mask, the inquisitor’s dark countenance usually conceals and ever darker heart. An inquisitor has been called by their deity to drive out heresy, and will not hesitate to interrogate or kill anyone who stands in his or her way. Inquisitors are perhaps best known for branding their opponents as heretics, marking them for divine retribution.",
