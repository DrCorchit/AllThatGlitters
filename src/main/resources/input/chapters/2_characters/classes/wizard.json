  "description": [
    "Cloistered in his high tower, a tall and heavily bearded man pushes arcane magic to its absolute limit. Bedecked in a great flowing robe and pointed hat, he ensures that the stars and planets align before pursuing his audacious experiment. Sanity and restraint long forsaken, he clutches a crystal ball, gazing somewhere within as blue electricity arcs from the tips of his fingers.",
    "No-one knows how he got his power; some say it runs in his blood, while others say that he was once a promising young student expelled from a university. Whatever the case, a wizard is someone with a naturally high aptitude for magic who usually practices on their own terms, outside the auspices of a university."
