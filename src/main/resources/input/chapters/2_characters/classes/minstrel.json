  "description": "A minstrel is easy to spot—simply listen for the sound of a cheering crowd, and see what has captured their attention. It might be a jester, or a woman with a guitar, or a halfling turning flips and cartwheels. Either way, the minstrel is occupied with the trade of entertainment. As one should be, if one feasts or goes hungry according to the quality of one’s performance.",
