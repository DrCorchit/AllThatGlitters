  "description": [
    "The knight is a low-ranking noble with formal combat training. Although they may be called to fight in battle, a knight’s primary purpose is to serve for the glory of their Lord or Lady, to whom they have sworn an oath of fealty. Many knights are also accompanied by a squire, a young knight in training who may carry their lord’s banner or help them don and doff their armor.",
    "On the battlefield, a knight is a magnificent sight, clad in expensive steel plate armor and with their lord’s ensignia emblazoned on their shield. However, some knights forgo a shield altogether, preferring a heavier two-handed weapon. Either way, knights train extensively and are rarely caught flat-footed, even when out of armor"
