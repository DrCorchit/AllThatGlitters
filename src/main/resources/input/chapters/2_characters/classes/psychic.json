  "name": "Psychic",
  "description": "The powers of a true psychic are a sight to behold. Imagine, for example, an unassuming young woman clad in simple black robes. She raises her hand and her eyes glow bright white, and suddenly the earth begins to tremble. A rock surges upward from the soil, bidden by her telekinetic impulse, and is sent flying towards its target. Surely such power is to be covetedâ€”and feared!",

    "Have your powers caused you to become an outcast, or changed the way that people view you?",
    "Do your powers imbue you with a sense of purpose, such as the desire to protect or dominate others?",
    "What made you leave your previous life and start adventuring?"
