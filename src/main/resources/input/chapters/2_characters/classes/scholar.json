  "name": "Scholar",
  "description": "Scholars are formally-trained magic users typically found in highly sheltered environments: libraries, universities, or perhaps a royal laboratory. Here, they are kept safe from the dangers and inconveniences of the outside world. Once in a great while, however, a scholar shuts the cover of his or her dusty tome and packs a bag to go adventuring. Whenever they do so, they are a force to be reckoned with, having mastered powerful forms of magic that have been thoroughly documented and perfected over generations.",
