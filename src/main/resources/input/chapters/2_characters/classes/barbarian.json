  "name": "Barbarian",
  "description": "Whether a local farmhand or a tribesman from a remote tundra or jungle, barbarians are united by their unparalleled fury in battle, as well as sheer physical brawn. By tapping into primal rage, barbarians can strike harder and faster than anyone else while laughing off blows that would stagger an ordinary man. Barbarians typically wear light armor, and swing the largest weapons they can find. Their bodies are often covered in scars, either from tribal initiation rituals, or past battles. Some barbarians channel their rage in a drunken stupor, while others transform into the animals that embody their inner beast.",
