<p>There are eight example races here, representing some favorite repeat offenders from the fantasy genre. That said,
  homebrewing new races is very much in the spirit of All that Glitters, and if a race you want to play isn’t in this
  list, you absolutely should create it. Alternatively, feel free to create your own lore for any of these races—don’t
  let my ideas stifle yours! Further on, I’ll explain some guidelines for creating new races while also respecting
  gameplay balance.
</p>
{{races}}
<h5>Custom Races</h5>
<p>When creating new races, consider following these general guidelines:</p>
<ol>
  <li>No stat bonus should exceed +2, and no stat penalty should exceed -2.</li>
  <li>The sum of all attribute bonuses minus all penalties should equal 1.</li>
  <li>Every race should have at least one proficiency bonus, but no more than 2.</li>
  <li>Ideally, the player should have some choices regarding either subraces, attributes, or proficiencies.</li>
  <li>Be careful making races that give +2 bonuses to both strength and dexterity, or both intelligence and will. Such
    races make very strong warriors or wizards respectively with very little downside.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5><a id="Size"></a>Size</h5>
<p>A character's race also determines their size. Size is not recorded on the character sheet, but is usually medium. If
  you picked a halfling, it's small. Size primarily affects what weapons a character can and can’t use, terminal
  velocity, and how effectively they can grapple. Grappling will be explained in further detail in <a
      href="c5.html#Grappling">chapter 5</a>, while fall damage and terminal velocity will be explained in <a
      href="c6.html#Falling">chapter 6</a>.
