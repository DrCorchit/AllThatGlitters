		<p>A character's combat class gives you an idea of both their fighting style and occupational background.
			Realtistically, these two are rarely separate. Unless you're an aristocrat, you don't have the time and
			money to aquire skills of little use within your day-to-day life. So a monk picks up his staff, a
			veteran takes his sword from the mantlepiece, or a scholar gathers her books. Each of them takes
			something familiar to them and does something extraordinary with it, as they begin their adventure.
		</p>
		<p>The easiest way to choose a class is to avoid all the details and just pick one that sounds cool. However, if
			you're of a mind to make an informed decision by carefully examine the unique features of each class, you
			certainly can. There are no wrong choices, only interesting ones.
		</p>
		<p>There is some ongoing debate as to the ideal number of classes in a TTRPG system. Too few classes, and
			players are less likely to find one that really captures their interest and vision. Too many, and the player
			is at risk of being drowned by excess choices—which may not be well balanced, either! I’ve decided to use 20
			classes, which are grouped into five categories, listed below. Players who struggle to pick a class can thus
			choose between one of these five categories and then choose between one of the four classes within that
			category. Hopefully it is easier to make two simple choices than one complicated choice.

<p>Here are the five categories:</p>
{{combat_categories}}
<p>In addition to each category’s attribute and proficiency bonus, each class category has a special bonus ability
  shared between all characters in that category. Here’s what each ability does:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Heavy Attack</b>: When making a strength-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 {{wp}} to increase the damage of
    your attack. If it hits, you may roll your weapon's damage die a second time and add its value to the total
    damage for the attack.
  </li>
  <li><b>Mana Regeneration</b>: When starting a combat turn with less than two willpower, gain one willpower.</li>
  <li><b>Precision Strike</b>: When making a dexterity-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 AP to gain +3 to hit on
    the attack roll and lower the critical threshold by 1. (i.e. from 20 to 19, typically.)
  </li>
  <li><b>Beast Speech</b>: You know the language of beasts, and may converse with them at any time. Once a day, you
    may expend 5 AP to attempt a persuasion check to convince an animal to fight by your side for 1 hour. The
    difficulty of the check depends on the type of animal being recruited.
  </li>
  <li><b>Meditation</b>: Once per long rest and while outside of combat, you may expend 5 AP to meditate or pray to
    your deity. You may increase an attribute of your choice by 2 for one hour, not exceeding the hard cap.
  </li>
</ul>
<p> In addition to these bonuses, the proficiency bonus of the base skill for each category advances to the next level
  at level 5 and again at level 10. This bonus cannot increase the proficiency bonus beyond mastery.
</p>
