<p>In a medieval or renaissance setting, very few characters are either physically or financially disposed to go
	cavorting about on grand adventures slaying dragons and dispatching necromancers and whatnot. Most of the characters
	in this sort of world are farmers, either working on a manor for their feudal lord or fending for themselves on the
	edges of civilization. Whether they're tied down by social expectations, afraid of death and the unkown, or just too
	damn comfortable, the simple fact is that <i>most people are not, and never will be, adventurers</i>.
</p>
<p>So who does go adventuring? If not the cowardly and mediocre, then only the strongest, boldest, and most daring
	individuals remain. <i>That's you!</i> Whether young or old, rich or poor, man or woman, an adventurer is someone
	who possesses <i>true courage</i>, and a compelling <i>vision</i>. Whatever your old life was, you're leaving it
	behind to try something new and exciting. Dangerous, certainly, but also glorious.

<p>Your backstory can be as long or short as you want it to be. Write from your heart, and create a character that
	resonates with you. As you write your backstory, try to think about what drove them to abandon their old life and
	become an adventurer. Here are some general questions to get you started:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Is your character the sort to make elaborate plans, or do they react to the world around them on the fly?</li>
	<li>Has anyone in their family ever been an adventurer? Are they inspired by legends of adventurers past?</li>
	<li>Does the idea of protecting the innocent and vulnerable resonate with your character?</li>
	<li>Was your character displaced by a natural disaster, such as a fire or flood?</li>
	<li>Has your character known financial extremes, such as wealth or poverty?</li>
	<li>What do they hope to find as an adventurer? Some adventurers seek fame, money, friendship, or true love, while
		others seek revenge or even adventure itself.
	</li>
	<li>Is your character leaving anything behind in their decision to go adventuring? Perhaps family, an ancestral home
		or village, or a spouse?
	</li>
	<li>How does your character come across to others? Are they amiable, eccentric, softspoken, confident, or perhaps
		dark and brooding?
	</li>
	<li>How does your character feel about the downsides of adventuring, such as death, injury, or poverty?</li>
	<li>Are there any unresolved threads from their old life that could come back to haunt them, such as a sworn enemy,
		estranged family, or the law?
	</li>
