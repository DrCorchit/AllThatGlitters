<p>Starting equipment depends heavily on your character's class. Some classes are well-prepared, bringing several unique
  items for unforeseen situations. Others have more scant preparations, bringing hardly more than the clothes on their
  back and a smattering of food and gold. If you do not feel your character's initial gear is appropriate for your
  character, discuss this with your DM. If they agree, you can exchange some of your starting gear for gold or items of
  equivalent value.
</p>
<p>Most classes also start with an initial sum of gold, which may be spent at a merchant or on combat training. You can
  supplement your character's gear by visiting a merchant before your adventure starts. The {{link.appendix_items}}
  lists typical merchant wares available for purchase. If you do plan to make a trip to a merchant, be considerate and
  plan your purchases in advance, to avoid an extended shopping spree.
