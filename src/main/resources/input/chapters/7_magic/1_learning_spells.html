<p>In order to learn a spell, a player must usually find a spellbook, scroll, or trainer who has knowledge of that
  specific spell. These would normally be found in larger towns and cities, or rarely in dungeons or out in the
  wilderness. Certain spells are so widespread that they are considered common knowledge and can be learned without a
  tome. Likewise, certain class abilities such as the Witch's eldritch tome or the scholar's codex arcana provide
  special access to arcane knowledge.
</p>
<p>Once an appropriate trainer or tome has been located, the player may have to meet certain requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A certain adventurer level</li>
  <li>A certain level of an attribute</li>
  <li>Proficiency in a certain skill</li>
  <li>Mastery of prerequisite spells</li>
  <li>A certain number of training slots</li>
</ul>
<p>Each spell lists its specific requirements in its description. Once all these requirements are met, the player learns
  the spell. The spell can only be unlearned if the player intentionally forgets it, usually in order to free up
  training slots.
</p>
<h5>Spell Rarities</h5>
<p>Some spells are much more commonly used and studied than others. Spells come in four rarities, which determine how
  difficult it is to acquire knowledge, as well as how others (such as NPCs) would likely react to seeing them used.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Common</b> spells are widely known and often used for very practical applications such as healing or repair.
    These spells are usually watered-down versions of more powerful spells studied by academic institutions.
  </li>
  <li><b>Scholarly</b> spells are studied and taught at a university level. They are generally inaccessible to the
    population at large, usually due to the high precision and innate talent required to cast correctly.
  </li>
  <li><b>Esoteric</b> spells are not taught by universities, even at a doctoral level. Learning of the existence of such
    a spell (let alone learning its practice) usually requires supernatural assistance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Forbidden</b> spells are not taught by universities, even at a doctoral level, for reasons other than legality.
    Some of these spells have been lost to time, while others are studied in secret by druids or cultists. The easiest
    way to learn esoteric spells is via supernatural assistance.
