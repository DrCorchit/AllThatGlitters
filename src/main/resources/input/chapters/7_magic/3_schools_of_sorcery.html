<blockquote>Any sensible treatise on magic will disclose the following insight: <i>magic is energy</i>. Therefore, magic
  is classified according to whence this energy originates, the techniques used to manipulate it, and finally according
  to the overall purpose of its application. In fact, all spells follow the same basic pattern, whereby the magus
  identifies a source of energy, imposes order over chaos, and finally unleashes this directed energy upon the world.

<p>Despite being intensely studied, magic remains an abstruse and opaque subject. Among those who study it, there is no
  consensus as to why certain individuals wield its power so effortlessly, why certain spells are so difficult to
  reproduce, and why other spells work at all. This inconvenience doesn't stop scholars from doing the one thing they
  are truly good at, however: categorizing things.
</p>
<p>A long time ago, spells were categorized into two types: thaumaturgy and divination. Thaumaturgical disciplines used
  the suffix -urgy, while divination schools used the suffix -mancy. For example, there was once a distinction between
  necromancy and necromurgy; the former was concerned with contacting deceased spirits, while the latter with raising
  their bodies. However, centuries of expanding magical theory as well as a good deal of linguistic bastardization have
  relegated such distinction to a mere footnote of history. Modern magic is divided into six schools of sorcery, which
  each have their own disciplines. These are listed below:
</p>
<h5>Alchemy</h5>
<p>An ancient school focused on interactions between magic and chemistry. It is said that the secret is in neither the
  magic nor the mixture, but in the harmony between the two. Alchemical spells are always enchantment rituals, where the
  magic is cast upon a potion or poison as it is brewed. Most potions lose their magical properties after a long rest,
  but can be restored via a short ritual. Optimal results are obtained when performed at an alchemical laboratory, but
  can be performed using field equipment in a pinch.

  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Biomancy</h5>
<p>The magic of living things, of the wild, and the human body. Magical techniques of this school are explored chiefly
  by the druids, who detest the term "biomancy" and have other names for their craft, such as <i>wyrdworking</i> and <i>shamanism</i>.
  Spells of this school are often not taught at a university level, and must be obtained from druid circles or the mad
  whisperings of the fey themselves.
