<p>Once a spell has been learned, certain additional requirements must be met in order to cast the spell. These
  requirements are unique to each spell, and detailed in the spell description. In general, most spells expend AP and
  require a main hand action to cast. However, some spells require two hands, while others can be cast with the offhand.
  Spell requirements are often related to how the spell is cast, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Evocations</b>: Spells which can be cast quickly and take effect instantaneously. So named because they often
    initiated by speaking a magical word. Casting the spell incurs a one-time expenditure of AP. Most of these are
    versatile spells with few material or circumstantial requirements.
  </li>
  <li><b>Concentration Spells</b>: Spells which are cast over a span of time. These spells usually require a burst of AP
    to initiate the spell and a smaller amount to maintain it. Concentration can be broken if the caster is damaged or
    distracted.
  </li>
  <li><b>Rituals</b>: Spells that require careful and methodic preparation. These spells are not normally cast during
    combat, but usually offer a better tradeoff of AP versus power. Rituals often require specific circumstances, such
    as certain weather conditions, positioning of the moon or stars, or access to a consecrated altar.
  </li>
  <li><b>Ceremonies</b>: Ceremonies are complex rituals that require more magical energy than is available to a single
    character. During a ceremony, each participant contributes some energy towards the casting of the spell. Like
    rituals, these spells often have special requirements.
  </li>
  <li><b>Enchantments</b>: An enchantment is a special type of ritual spell where the magic is infused into a physical
    object or substance, such as a sword, piece of armor, or an alchemical brew. The enchantment's magic lingers long
    after the spell is cast.
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Targeting Spells</h5>
<p>Many spells have a range of effectiveness and target a certain area of the battlefield. Every spell has a target, of
  one of the following types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Self</b>: The spell targets the caster of the spell only.</li>
  <li><b>Touch</b>: The spell targets one or more creatures that the spellcaster is able to physically touch.</li>
  <li><b>Range</b>: The spell affects some or all targets of a specific type within a given range.</li>
  <li><b>Shape</b>: The spell targets a specific area within range, based on one of the shapes described below. If the
    range is zero, the shape is targeted on the caster.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Most spells that target something within a range require line-of-sight to the target. A spell can be cast on a target
  without line-of-sight only if the description explicitly says so. The caster always has line-of-sight to themselves.
</p>
<p>Spells that target a shape use one of the following shapes:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Shape</th>
    <th>Effect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sphere</td>
    <td>Affects all targets which overlap a sphere. The sphere's radius is specified by the spell.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cylinder</td>
    <td>Affects all targets which overlap a vertical cylinder. The cylinder's radius and height are specified by the
      spell.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cone</td>
    <td>Affects all targets which overlap a horizontal cone, with the tip at the point of origination. The cone's length
      is specified by the spell. Its angle defaults to 45 if not specified.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Line</td>
    <td>Affects all targets in the path of the line. The length is specified by the spell. The width defaults to 1 if
      not otherwise specified. If the spell target is self, then one of the line endpoints ends on the caster's tile.
      The caster decides if the spell includes their tile or not.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cube</td>
    <td>Affects all targets within a cube. The edge length of the cube is specified by the spell. The cube is centered
