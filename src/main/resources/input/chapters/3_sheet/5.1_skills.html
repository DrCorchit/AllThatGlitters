<p>Skills are related to attributes in that they are also used for event rolls. Every skill has an underlying supporting
  attribute, whose modifier is added to the roll as with an attribute check. In addition to this, players add a bonus
  from training called a proficiency bonus. The number rolled on the d20 plus the modifier plus the proficency bonus
  added together determine the final value for the skill check.
</p>
<p>Although every skill depends on at least one attribute, several skills have a secondary supporting attribute whose
  modifier may be used instead, under certain circumstances. For example, a player who is sneaking may decide that they
  are too clumsy to move quietly and instead opt to sprint past the guard while his gaze is turned. In this case, the
  player is trying to use their modifier for speed instead of dexterity for the stealth check. Whether this type of
  substitution is allowed is situational. Certain circumstances may <i>require</i> that the alternative attribute score
  modifier is used, while others may allow the player to choose whichever is higher.
