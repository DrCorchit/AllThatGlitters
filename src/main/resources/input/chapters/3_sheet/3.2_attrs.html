<p><br/>In addition to these effects, each attribute supports one or more skills, which are used during event rolls.
  Importantly, each attribute affects multiple aspects of gameplay, meaning that players should care about which stats
  they prioritize and which they neglect. Not every character needs to be well-rounded, but characters with unusual
  ability score distributions should feel somewhat unbalanced to play.

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: In some situations, we do not use the attribute score directly, but the
  <a id="modifier"></a>modifier.
  The modifier for an attribute is obtained by subtracting 10 from the attribute score. An average human with 10 for all
  attribute scores would thus have 0 for their modifiers.

<p>If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, your attributes are going to be determined by your
  racial and class bonuses. Adding these together should give you 6 numbers. Copy these into the "attributes" section
  and then move on to equipment.
