<p>Found in the upper right corner, this section tracks several important statistics.</p>
<h5>Hitpoints</h5>
<p>Hitpoints (HP) are a resource that cause the player to fall unconscious when fully depleted. A character’s maximum HP
  is initially equal to their strength score and increases each level by one half their strength score.
</p>
<h5>Ability Points</h5>
<p>Ability Points (AP) are expended as the player uses powerful spells and abilities. When AP is fully depleted, the
  character is said to be exhausted. There is not an immediate penalty for this condition, other than not being able to
  use critically necessary abilities. Maximum ability points is equal to a players level plus their willpower attribute,
  but can be increased further by various bonuses.
</p>
<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>Mitigation (MIT) is a derived statistic which determines how likely a player is to successfully dodge or block an
  attack, similar to armor class from D&amp;D. During combat, melee and ranged attacks are treated as an event roll
  testing the martial arts or accuracy skill respectively. In this situation, mitigation provides the difficulty
  threshold for whether the attack succeeds. Thus, players with high mitigation are hit less often and therefore survive
  longer.
</p>
<p>Mitigation is composed primarily of two values: dodge chance (DC), conferred by the player’s dexterity attribute, and
  block chance (BC), conferred by the player’s shields and armor. A third value, parry chance, is added when a player is
  actively attempting to parry an attack. The three values are added together to calculate total mitigation, but certain
  attacks may bypass some or all of the three values, reducing effective mitigation against that tactic. For example,
  most types of armor are not ideal for absorbing blows from blunt weapons. Accordingly, bludgeoning damage
  automatically bypasses half of the target’s BC.
</p>
<p>The player’s DC is normally equal to their dexterity attribute, while BC is determined by the player's choice of <a
    href="appendix_armor.html">armor</a>. Parry chance is determined by the character's weapon, if the weapon is capable
  of parrying. If the character is not parrying or their weapon does not allow parrying, parry chance is zero. If you're
  filling out the sheet for the first time, put your dexterity score under DC and your armor BC plus your shield BC (if
  you have one) under BC. Add the two together, and that's your base mitigation stat.
</p>
<h5>Gold</h5>
<p>Gold is the currency of the land, whether pounds, doubloons, or rupees. Gold is used in a variety of ways, mainly to
  buy equipment from merchants, hire trainers, or stock up on camping supplies. In order to simplify the economy, only
  one type of currency is used. If other currencies such as copper or silver pieces, the value is expressed in terms of
  gold. In practical terms, one gold represents about one day's wages for a peasant laborer or farmer.
</p>
<h5>Training Slots</h5>
<p>Training slots are a resource that controls how often a character can learn new abilities from training. You
  temporarily expend training slots whenever you learn a new ability (other than a class ability). If you don't have
  enough training slots for a new ability, you may have to forget an ability to regain the required training slots, or
  wait until you level up. If you're just making a character you won't have used any training slots, so they will be at
  maximum, which is normally equal to your intelligence attribute score.
