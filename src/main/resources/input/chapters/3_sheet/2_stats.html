<p>Found in the topmost right corner, this section tracks several important statistics:</p>
<h5>Hitpoints</h5>
<p>Hitpoints (HP) measure hardiness and vitality. When a creature's hitpoints fall to zero, they succumb to their wounds
  and fall unconscious. A character’s maximum HP is initially equal to their strength score and increases each level by
  one half their strength score. The base value can be bolstered by other effects such as class feature, feats, or
  magical gear.
</p>
<pre>{{strings.max_hp_formula}}</pre>
<h5>Willpower</h5>
<p>Willpower (WP) is expended as the player uses powerful spells and abilities. When WP is fully depleted, the character
  is said to be exhausted. There is not an immediate penalty for this condition, other than not being able to use
  critically important abilities. Maximum willpower is equal to 10 plus a player's {{attr.CHA}} and {{attr.NST}}
  modifiers.
</p>
<pre>{{strings.max_wp_formula}}</pre>
<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>Mitigation (MIT) is a derived statistic which determines how likely a character is to successfully avoid damage from
  an attack, similar to armor class from D&amp;D. During combat, melee and ranged attacks are treated as an event roll
  testing the martial arts or accuracy skill of the attacking player. Mitigation provides the difficulty threshold that
  determines whether the attack succeeds. Thus, players with high mitigation are hit less often and survive longer.
</p>
<p>Mitigation is composed of two values: dodge chance (DC) and block chance (BC). Dodge chance is initially equal to the
  player’s dexterity attribute, while block chance is determined by the character’s shields and armor. The two values
  are added together to calculate total mitigation. Note that DC is reduced after every attack by the attacker's
  {{attr.DEX}} modifier, whether the attack is successful or not. Dodge chance is also reduced to zero (for both
  characters) when a character is grappled.
</p>
<p>DC, BC, and MIT are calculated as follows:</p>
<pre>{{strings.dc_formula}}</pre>
<pre>{{strings.bc_formula}}</pre>
<pre>{{strings.mit_formula}}</pre>
<p style="margin-left:25px;">Note: The character sheet is meant to record the base mitigation statistic. Temporary or
  conditional bonuses (such as from potions, spells, or parrying) should not be recorded here.
</p>
<p>To calculate effective MIT against an attack, add any circumstantial bonuses or penalties to BC and DC to the base
  mitigation value. For example, specific potions increase DC, while the parry reaction or certain spells improve BC.
</p>
<h5>Gold</h5>
<p>Gold measures a character's material wealth, and does not necessarily correspond to a specific number of gold coins
  or any specific currency. Coins made from other metals such as copper or silver are converted to their gold value when
  recorded on the character sheet. Gold is mainly used to purchase goods and services, such as buying equipment from
  merchants or hiring trainers.
</p>
<h5>Status</h5>
<p>This section records any status effects inflicted on your character.
</p>
<h5>Training Slots</h5>
<p>Training slots are a resource that control how often a character can learn new abilities from training. Characters
  expend training slots whenever they learn new feats or spells. If they don't have enough training slots for a new
  ability, they may have to forget an ability to regain the required training slots, or wait until they level up. If
  you're just making a character, you won't have used any training slots, so they will be at maximum, which is equal to
  your intelligence attribute score. Training slots are explained in more detail in {{files.c6#chapter 6}}.
