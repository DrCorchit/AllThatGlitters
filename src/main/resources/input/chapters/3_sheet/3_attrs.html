<p>The six attributes, <i>Strength</i>, <i>Dexterity</i>, <i>Speed</i>, <i>Intelligence</i>, <i>Instinct</i>, and <i>
  Charisma</i>, describe the raw physical and mental capabilities of a character. Each attribute has a value typically
  from 0 to 20, with a score of 0 indicating a total absence of the attribute (as with someone who is dead or
  unconscious) while a score of 20 indicating a nearly superhuman level of aptitude. For humans, a score of ten
  indicates an average level of proficiency.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: In some situations, we do not use the attribute score directly, but the <a
    id="modifier"></a><i>modifier</i>. The modifier for an attribute is obtained by subtracting 10 from the attribute
  score. An average human with 10 for all attribute scores would thus have 0 for their modifiers.

<p>Each attribute affects multiple aspects of gameplay, meaning that players should care about which stats they
  prioritize and which they neglect. Not every character needs to be well-rounded, but characters with unusual ability
  score distributions should feel somewhat unbalanced to play.
</p>
<p>If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, your attributes are going to be determined by your
  racial and class bonuses. Go ahead and add up the totals and record them onto your character sheet, then move to the
  next section. Your attribute scores will increase later on as you level up.
