<p>Now that we've covered the various components of the character sheet, let's walk through the process of creating a
  character and filling out the sheet. Let's create a character named "Arnoch Strontorius":
</p>
<blockquote> Arnoch is a wizard, preferring to explore the application of arcane energy outside the auspices of
  university. He comes from a long line of adventurers, all the way back to his thrice-great grandfather, Sapio
  Strontorius. Back in the day, Sapio made a name for himself as a mercenary who wielded his hand-and-a-half sword and
  elemental magic with equal finesse. Although Arnoch has a lot to live up to, he's already shown himself as a magical
  prodigy. A string of family anecdotes recount his abilities, including a time when he burnt down an entire outhouse
  and several trees at the wee age of three, despite not having any formal training in pyromancy. Arnoch has always been
  enamored with flames, and fireball is his favorite spell. He says his favorite sound is the silence that comes just
  before a fireball (usually hurled by Arnoch himself) strikes and explodes, although the sound of dry tinder bursting
  into flame is a close second. His family has always encouraged him to develop his talents, and are very excited to
  send their little pyromaniac off on his first adventure.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Although Arnoch's got a bit of elven ancestry from way back when, he's mainly just an old-fashioned,
  home-grown human raised on the family farm. (Meaning the true source of his powers remains a mystery.) Arnoch has a
  strong moral compass, but  little regard for the law, making him unpredictable and threat to corrupt politicians.
  As Arnoch sets out to find his fortune, he little guesses just what he's heading into... or that he is already being
  watched, on account of his extraordinary powers.
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we've established Arnoch's background, let's fill in his character sheet. First we write "Arnoch
  Strontorius" in the info section, followed by "wizard" as his class and "1" as his level. Below this, we write "human"
  and "CG" or "Chaotic Good" as his alignment.
</p>
<p>In the next section, we need Arnoch's attributes. As a human, we can choose to improve two of Arnoch's attributes by
  1, by decreasing two others by 1. We'll increase his {{attr.INT}} and {{attr.CHA}}, at the cost of his {{attr.SPD}}
  and {{attr.STR}}. As a wizard, he gains +2 to {{attr.INT}} and {{attr.CHA}}. Adding these together, Arnoch's
  attributes are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>STR</b>: 9</li>
  <li><b>DEX</b>: 10</li>
  <li><b>SPD</b>: 9</li>
  <li><b>INT</b>: 13</li>
  <li><b>NST</b>: 10</li>
  <li><b>CHA</b>: 13</li>
</ul>
<p>We can now go ahead and enter these values under "Attributes", and then move on to the statistics section. At level
  1, max HP is equal to Strength, so we enter "9" as his max HP. Arnoch's {{attr.NST}} modifier is +0 and his
  {{attr.CHA}} modifier is +3. We add these together and then add 10 to calculate his max willpower of 13. Finally, his
  intelligence of 13 means that he has 13 training slots. Since he hasn't learned any new abilities yet, his training
  slots are at maximum.
</p>
<p>Now let's calculate his mitigation stat. He's wearing sorcerer's robes, so his block chance is zero. Meanwhile, his
  dexterity is 10, which is his dodge chance. For his mitigation stat, we write:
</p>
<pre>Block + Dodge = Mitigation
0     + 10    = 10</pre>
<p>The next sections are abilities, backstory, and equipment.</p>
