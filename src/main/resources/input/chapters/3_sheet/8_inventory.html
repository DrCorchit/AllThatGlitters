<p>The final aspect of your character is their inventory, which includes everything they are carrying other than
  equipped weapons and armor. If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, you should refer to your
  class choice to find your initial loadout. When you find additional items during your adventure, you'll add them here.
  You don't need to add your equipped weapons and armor here, though. Those have their own section on your character
  sheet. If you unequip weapons or armor, don't forget to add them to your inventory.
</p>
<p>Inventory items are categorized as weapons, gear (clothing, armor, and jewelry), tools, and consumables. All of these
  items are stored in your adventurer's pack. If any inventory item is equipped (such as a magic ring or amulet) you can
  put a star or other special mark next to it, to indicate that it is worn. There is no limit to the number of magical
  items you can equip, although you can't gain benefits from wearing multiple items of the same type or on the same
  bodypart. For example, you can't receive the bonuses from two amulets or rings at once, even if your character chooses
  to wear them.
