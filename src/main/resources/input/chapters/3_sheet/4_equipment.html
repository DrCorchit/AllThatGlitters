<p>This section records your character's equipped weapons and armor. Magical trinkets are not recorded here, but under
  "inventory", even if they are currently being worn.
</p>
<h5>Weapons</h5>
<p>To fill out this section, copy down the names and damage of the weapons you chose when you created your character.
  For example, let's suppose you're playing a character with a strength score of 13 and a dexterity score of 15. If you
  chose a longsword, you would write:
</p>
<pre>Longsword 1d12+3</pre>
<p>The 1d12 is the die used by the weapon, while the +3 comes from your strength, because the longsword is a strength
  weapon. On the other hand, if you chose a katana, you would enter:
<p>
<pre>Katana 1d8+5</pre>
<p>Since the katana is a nimble weapon, you want to use whichever is higher of strength and dexterity for damage. Since
  15 is higher than 13, you would use dexterity.
</p>
<p>Finally, write down whichever modifiers apply to that weapon. You can refer to {{files.appendix_weapons}} for more
  information on weapons and modifiers. If you're fully familiar with your weapon's modifiers, I suggest using this
  space to record the abilities of any magical weapons you equip.
</p>
<p>A player can carry up to two weapons, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A single two-handed weapon</li>
  <li>A one-handed weapon, plus a buckler, shield, or small weapon in the offhand</li>
  <li>Two light weapons, such as two shortswords or two daggers</li>
  <li>A light weapon and a greatshield</li>
  <li>A one-handed weapon, with the offhand kept free to cast spells</li>
</ul>
<p>If you only carry one weapon, leave the "offhand" column blank.</p>
<h5>Armor</h5>
<p>Under the "armor" section, write down the type of armor your character is wearing and the associated BC. For example,
  if your character is a knight you would start out wearing half plate. Therefore, you would write:
</p>
<pre>Name: Half Plate BC: 12</pre>
<p>If you don't know the BC of your armor, you can look it up in {{files.appendix_armor}}</p>
