<h5>Weapons</h5>
<p>This section records your character's equipped weapons and armor. Magical trinkets are not recorded here, but under
  "inventory", even if they are currently being worn.
</p>
<p>To fill out this section, copy down the name and damage of the weapon you chose when you created your character. For
  example, let's suppose you're playing a character with a strength score of 13 and a dexterity score of 15. If you
  chose a longsword, you would write: <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Longsword 1d12+3</span>. The 1d12 is the
  die used by the weapon, while the +3 comes from your strength, because the longsword is a strength weapon. On the
  other hand, if you chose a katana, you would enter <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Katana 1d8+5</span>. Since
  the katana is a nimble weapon, you want to use whichever is higher of strength and dexterity for damage. Since 15 is
  higher than 13, you would use dexterity. Finally, write down whichever modifiers apply to that weapon. If you run out
  of space, just write the most important modifiers. You can refer to <a href="appendix_weapons.html">Appendix:
    Weapons</a> for more information on weapons and modifiers.
</p>
<p>A player can carry up to two weapons, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A single two-handed weapon</li>
  <li>A one-handed weapon, plus a buckler, shield, or small weapon in the offhand</li>
  <li>Two light weapons, such as two shortswords or two daggers</li>
  <li>A light weapon and a greatshield</li>
  <li>A one-handed weapon, with the offhand kept free to cast spells</li>
</ul>
<p>If you only carry one weapon, leave the "offhand" column blank.</p>
<h5>Armor</h5>
<p>Under the "armor" section, write down the type of armor your character is wearing and the associated BC. For example,
  if your character is a knight you would start out wearing half plate. Therefore, you would write <span
      style="font-family: Courier New">Half Plate (BC 8)</span>. If you're not carrying a shield and no other bonuses
  apply, this is the same value as what you entered under "BC" in the "Statistics" section.
