<p>Abilities are specific skills that confer some benefit to the player, such as spells or feats. Abilities are
  categorized in a few ways. First, abilities acquired from a player’s class (such as the barbarian’s rage) are called
  innate abilities. Abilities learned from trainers are called trained abilities, and finally trained abilities which
  have been fully mastered are called rote abilities. Abilities that aren't spells or innate are called feats.
</p>
<p>Abilities are also classified by whether or not they are explicitly invoked by the player or if they take effect
  automatically. The former are called active abilities and usually cost WP to activate, while the latter are called
  passive abilities (or perks) and usually take effect without the use of WP.
</p>
<p>An example of a passive ability would be a perk that restores HP at the start of the player’s turn. Since the player
  is not required to do anything to receive this benefit, it is passive. On the other hand, an ability that allows the
  player to spend WP to deal extra damage would be an active ability.
</p>
<p>In this section, write down the name of any abilities you learn, followed by the training slots used by that ability.
  Innate abilities don't need to go here, since they are determined by your class. If an ability is known by rote, leave
  the "training slots" column for that ability blank. If you're filling out a character sheet for a level one character,
  this section will be mostly blank except for any starting spells.
