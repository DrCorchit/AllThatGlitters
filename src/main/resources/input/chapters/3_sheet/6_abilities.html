<p>Abilities are learned or innate skills that confer some benefit to the player, such as spells or combat maneuvers.
  Abilities are categorized in a few ways. First, abilities acquired from a player’s class (such as the barbarian’s
  rage) are called innate abilities. Abilities learned from trainers are called trained abilities, and finally trained
  abilities which have been fully mastered are called rote abilities.
</p>
<p>Abilities are also classified by whether or not they are explicitly invoked by the player or if they take effect
  automatically. The former are called active abilities and usually cost AP to activate, while the latter are called
  passive abilities (or perks) and take effect without the use of AP.
</p>
<p>An example of a passive ability would be a perk that restores HP at the start of the player’s turn. Since the player
  is not required to do anything to receive this benefit, it is passive. On the other hand, an ability that allows the
  player to spend AP to deal extra damage would be an active ability.

<p>In this section, write down the name of any learned or rote abilities you have acquired, followed by the training
  slots used by that ability. Innate abilities don't need to go here, since they are determined by your class. If an
  ability is rote, just leave the "training slots" column for that ability blank. Your training slots
