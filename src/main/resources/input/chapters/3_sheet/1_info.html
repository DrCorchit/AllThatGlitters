<p>This section is found in the topmost right section of the character sheet, and records the most basic information
  about your character, including their name, combat class, level and race. Race, class, and alignment are discussed in
  more detail in the <a href="c2.html" rel="prev">previous chapter</a>. Except for your character level, information in
  this section usually doesn't change.
