<p>This section is found in the topmost left section of the character sheet, and records the most basic information
  about your character, including their name, combat class, level, race, and alignment. Races, classes, and alignments are discussed in
  more detail in the <a href="c2.html" rel="prev">previous chapter</a>. Except for your character level, information in
  this section usually doesn't change.
