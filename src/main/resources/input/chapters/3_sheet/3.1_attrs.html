<p>The six attributes, <i>Strength</i>, <i>Dexterity</i>, <i>Speed</i>, <i>Intelligence</i>, <i>Charisma</i>, and <i>
  Willpower</i>, describe the raw physical and mental capabilities of a character. Each attribute has a value typically
  from 0 to 20, with a score of 0 indicating a total absence of the attribute (as with someone who is dead or
  unconscious) while a score of 20 indicating a nearly superhuman level of aptitude. For humans, a score of ten
  indicates an average level of proficiency.
