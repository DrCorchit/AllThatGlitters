<p>Skills are related to attributes in that they are also used for event rolls. Every skill has an underlying supporting
  attribute, whose modifier is added to the roll as with an attribute check. In addition to this, players add a bonus
  from training called a proficiency bonus. The final value of the skill check equals the number rolled on the d20 plus
  the attribute modifier plus the proficency bonus, as follows:
</p>
<pre>{{strings.skill_check_formula}}</pre>
<p>Although every skill depends on at least one attribute, several skills have a secondary supporting attribute whose
  modifier may be used instead, under certain circumstances. For example, a player who is sneaking may decide that they
  are too clumsy to move quietly and instead opt to sprint past the guard while his gaze is turned. In this case, the
  player is trying to use their modifier for speed instead of dexterity for the stealth check. Whether this type of
  substitution is allowed is situational. Certain circumstances may <i>require</i> that the alternative attribute score
  modifier is used, while others may allow the player to choose whichever is higher.
</p>
<p>When filling out this section, copy the <a href="#modifier">modifier</a> of the relevant attribute under the column
  labeled "base". Then, record your proficiency bonus (if any) under "bonus". Add the two together to calculate your
  total bonus for that skill. For example, if your character has a dexterity score of 13 and proficiency in
  {{skills.accuracy}}, you would fill out the entry for the accuracy skill as follows:
</p>
<pre>Base + Bonus = Total
3    + 2     = +5</pre>
<p>Here is a list of all skills:</p>
{{skills}}
<p>There are five levels of proficiency in each skill. Each proficiency level has a corresponding bonus, as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Level</th>
    <th>Roll Bonus</th>
    <th>Perks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Deficient</td>
    <td>-2</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Proficient</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Can expend 5 willpower to roll with advantage.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Expert</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Can expend 4 willpower to roll with advantage.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mastery</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Can expend 3 willpower to roll with advantage. Can reroll a natural one once per skill check.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Each of these labels indicate that the player has either undertaken training or has an especial weakness in that
  skill. Deficiencies can be overcome and expertise and mastery can be attained through training even after a character
  is made.
</p>
<p>When players obtain proficiency bonuses to the same skill from multiple sources, they do not combine to advance oneâ€™s
  proficiency in that skill to the next level. However, if a player acquires proficiency for the same skill from both
  their race and class, they may take proficiency in a new skill to replace the doubled proficiency.
