<p>There are five levels of proficiency in each skill. Each proficiency level has a corresponding bonus, as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Deficient</td>
    <td>-2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Proficient</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Expert</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mastery</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Each of these labels indicate that the player has either undertaken training or has an especial weakness in that
  skill. Deficiencies can be overcome and expertise and mastery can be attained through training even after a character
  is made.
</p>
<p>When players obtain proficiency bonuses to the same skill from multiple sources, they do not combine to advance one’s
  proficiency in that skill to the next level. The only exception to this rule is that proficiency bonuses from a
  player’s race and class can be combined, allowing a player to begin the game with expert level in that skill.
