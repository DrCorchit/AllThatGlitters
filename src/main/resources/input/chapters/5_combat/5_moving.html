<p>At the start of their turn, characters gain movement points equal to half their speed attribute score. When moving
  around on a rectangular battle grid, players expend 1 movement point for every vertical, horizontal, or diagonal move.
  Optionally, players can opt to use fractional movement points. Under this system, diagonal movement costs 1.5 movement
  points, effectively making the set of reachable tiles more circular. This also makes odd movement points more
  relevant, but increases the complexity of maneuvering. In any case, a character cannot enter a tile unless they have
  the required amount of movement points remaining. For example, a character with 5.5 movement points would be able to
  move at most 5 tiles horizontally or vertically.

<p>In a 5-second combat round with 5-foot square tiles, a speed of 10 (average) translates to 5 feet per second, or
  around 3.5 miles per hours. This implies a typical jog speed of 7 miles per hour, and a sprint speed of 14 miles per
  hours.
