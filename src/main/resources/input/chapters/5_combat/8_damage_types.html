<p>Smashing, slashing, poisoning, burningâ€¦ There are quite a few ways to do someone in. When damage is dealt by an
  attack or spell, it always comes with a damage type that modifies the original effect. Here's a list of damage types
  and their unique effects:
</p>{{damage_types}}
<p>A few notes on damage types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a character takes force damage exceeding their strength score, they must make a strength saving throw with DT
    equal to the force damage dealt or be knocked prone.
  </li>
  <li>Metal armor protects the wearer from lightning damage by acting as a <a

  </li>
  <li>Successful attacks with acid decrease the target's BC by 1, until zero. The armor can be repaired at a blacksmith
    for 20 gold per BC lost.
  </li>
  <li>Good-aligned characters possess resistance to holy damage, and vulnerability to profane damage. Conversely,
    evil-aligned characters and the undead possess resistance to profane damage and vulnerability to holy damage.
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Vulnerability, Resistance, and Immunity</h5>
<p>Besides their inherent effects, damage types may deal differing amounts of damage to creatures depending on their
  vulnerabilities. Every creature has one of four levels of vulnerability to each damage type, modifying incoming damage
  of that type as follows:

  <tr>
    <td>Vulnerable</td>
    <td>Damage is doubled</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td>No effect</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Resistant</td>
    <td>Damage is halved</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Immune</td>
    <td>Damage is voided</td>
  </tr>
