<p>Smashing, slashing, poisoning, burningâ€¦ There are quite a few ways to do someone in. Here's a list of damage types
  and their unique effects:
</p>
<h5>Common Damage Types:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Slashing</b>: Liable to cause bleeding.</li>
  <li><b>Bludgeoning</b>: +3 to hit versus plate armors.</li>
  <li><b>Piercing</b>: +3 to hit versus mail armors.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Rare Damage Types:</h5>

<p>A few notes on damage types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slashing, fire, and ice damage deal one level of their respective status effects per hit.</li>
  <li>When a character takes force damage exceeding their strength score, they must make a strength saving throw with DT
    equal to the force damage dealt or be knocked prone.
  </li>
  <li>Successful attacks with acid decrease the target's BC by 1, until zero. The armor can be repaired at a blacksmith
    for 20 gold per BC lost.
  </li>
  <li>Good-aligned characters possess resistance to holy damage, and vulnerability to profane damage. Conversely,
    evil-aligned characters and the undead possess resistance to profane damage and vulnerability to holy damage.
  </li>
