<p>Combat is pure chaos. It's nothing like the movies; you won't find any choreographed fencing with somersaults and
  pirouettes, dramatic music, or witty banter. Real combat is full of noise and blood and grime, broken bones, and the
  screams of the dyingâ€”or the eerie silence of the dead. Be that as it may, mortal combat is actually the most advanced
  form problem-solving on a great many worlds. So you'd better get good at it.

<p>In order to make sense out of chaos, the battlefield is represented with a grid and time is divided into <i>turns</i>
  and <i> rounds</i>. Each grid square represents a 5-by-5 foot square of terrain, while a turn of combat captures a
  single fighter doing their best to kill and not be killed for a single 5-second snapshot of time. Finally, a round is
  completed when all combatants have completed their turn. Once combat has started, it continues through as many rounds
  as it needs to until only one faction remains, and all others have either surrendered, fled, or been slain. Then it
  ends, as quickly as it began.
