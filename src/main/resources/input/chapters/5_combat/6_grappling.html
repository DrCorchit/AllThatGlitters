<p>A player can attempt to grapple an enemy by using both a main and offhand action. The attacker and the defender then
  both roll a martial arts skill check, with the grapple succeeding if the attacker's score is greater than or equal to
  the defender's score. Once grappled, the defender cannot move or take main or offhand actions during their turn.
  However, they can reroll their martial arts check once each turn, until their score is higher than the score rolled by
  the attacker. At this point, they are no longer grappled and will be able to move and act normally on their next turn.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Relative size affects grappling chances, as follows: If a character attempts to
  grapple an enemy that is smaller than themselves, they gain advantage on the martial arts check. If they attempt to
  grapple an enemy larger than themselves, they gain disadvantage. No character may grapple a character more than one
  size class larger than they are.
</p>
<p>During a grapple, a few special rules take effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The DC of both combatants is reduced to zero, lowering their MIT.</li>
  <li>The grappled character's BC is added to the attacker's BC.</li>
  <li>The grappled character acts as a meatshield, taking full damage from failed attacks against the grappling
    character.
  </li>
  <li>A character can attempt to break an ally free from being grappled by using the help action. In this case, both
    characters roll for martial arts. If either roll is higher than the grappler's martial arts roll, the grapple
    condition ends.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If a player is grappling an enemy at the start of their turn, their moveset is restricted to the following actions:
</p>
<p><b>Dragging</b>: The character moves at half speed, bringing the grappled foe along with them.</p>
<p><b>Throwing</b> costs a main and offhand action. The player makes a strength check with a DT equal to the enemy's
  strength score. If successful, the throw distance is 5 feet plus an additional foot for every point their strength
  check exceeded the enemy's strength score.
</p>
<p><b>Regrappling</b> costs a main and offhand action and allows the grappler to reroll the initial martial arts check
  of the grapple with advantage, potentially increasing the DT of the defender's check to break free on subsequent
  turns. However, if the new grapple score is lower than the defender's original grapple score, the defender immediately
  breaks free from the grapple. Regrappling is mainly useful if the attacker's initial grapple score was lower than
  expected, and the defender is likely to break out on future turns.
</p>
<p><b>Releasing</b> an enemy costs no effort, and the grappler can move and attack as normal on their turn. They will
  have to pass another martial arts check to grapple the enemy again, but have advantage on attack rolls against the
  same creature.
