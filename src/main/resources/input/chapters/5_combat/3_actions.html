<p>At the beginning of every combat turn, players gain one main hand action, one offhand action, and movement points
  equal to their speed attribute. The various actions taken during the turn deplete these resources until the player has
  no more abilities to use, at which point their turn ends. Monsters may have more or fewer actions than human players,
  but otherwise their combat turns proceed in essentially the same way.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Some combat actions, such as a two-handed weapon attack, use both the main hand and
  offhand action.
</p>
<h4><a id="Reacting"></a>Reacting</h4>
<p>Reactions are moves a character makes in response to specific triggers, such as an enemy moving into or out of melee
  range. Characters use reactions before their turn starts, and normally may make one reaction per turn. Common examples
  of reactions include parrying, blocking with a shield, and opportunity attacks.
</p>
<p>For example, if a player is engaged in melee combat with a monster that turns and runs away, the player can make a
  reaction called an opportunity attack. The opportunity attack allows the player to make a main hand (or two handed)
  weapon attack against the monster outside the player's normal turn. Most monsters are also capable of scoring
  opportunity attacks against players, but players can use the disengage action to avoid this. Disengage allows the
  player to move out of melee range without triggering the opportunity attack reaction, useful for repositioning.
</p>
<p>The following chart displays some actions and reactions typically available to players:</p>
