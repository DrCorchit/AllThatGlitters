<p>Sometimes characters fall prey to certain temporary conditions that reduce their effectiveness in combat. These
  conditions are called status effects and begin and end under certain conditions. Also, some status effects can
  accumulate, meaning they can be inflicted multiple times on the same character.
</p>
{{status_effects}}
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 point of healing cancels out 1 point of bleeding.</li>
  <li>When using the help action to treat bleeding, the character providing assistance must pass a {{skills.medicine}}
    check (DT equal to twice the bleeding amount). On a success, bleeding is reduced by half.
  </li>
  <li>Freezing and burning status effects are mutually exclusive. One turn of freezing cancels out one turn of burning,
    and vice versa.
