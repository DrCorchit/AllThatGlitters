<p>Sometimes characters fall prey to certain temporary conditions that reduce their effectiveness in combat. These
  conditions are called status effects and begin and end under certain conditions. Also, some status effects can
  accumulate, meaning they can be inflicted multiple times on the same character.

    <td>Bleeding</td>
    <td>Accumulates. Each turn, the target takes damage equal to the number of turns of bleeding remaining, and then
      lowers their bleeding level by 1.
    </td>
    <td>Inflicted by slashing damage.</td>
    <td>Alleviated by a short rest, or when an ally takes the "help" action and passes a medicine check.</td>
    <td>Enemies not composed of flesh are immune.</td>

    <td>Blinded</td>
    <td>The target cannot see, has disadvantage on attack rolls, and automatically fails any ability checks and saving
      throws based on sight.

    <td>Antidote, or wait until vision returns naturally.</td>
    <td>Some characters that use echolocation or magical sight are immune to this condition.</td>

    <td>Burning</td>
    <td>The target takes 1d4 fire damage each turn. If accumulated <i>burning</i> exceeds the target's WILL score at the
      start of the target's turn, they are incapacitated by pain for that turn.

  <tr>
    <td>Intoxicated</td>
    <td>Accumulates. Reduces DEX and INT by 1 for every level. The target becomes incapacitated and falls unconscious
      for 1d4 hours when intoxication level exceeds strength score.

    <td>Inflicted by alcohol and certain drugs or poisons.</td>
    <td>One level of intoxication is lost per hour.</td>

    <td>Freezing</td>
    <td>Accumulates. The target's DEX is reduced by 1 for each turn of accumulated freezing. Freezing decreases by 1 at
      the end of every turn, or when cancelled out by fire damage.

      other forms of damage.

  cancels out one turn of burning, and vice versa.
