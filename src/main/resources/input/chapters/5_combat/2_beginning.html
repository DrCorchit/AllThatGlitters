<h5>Initiative</h5>
<p>Combat begins with a skill check, as both players and npc combatants roll for initiative. This determines move order,
  with higher scores moving first. In <i>All That Glitters</i>, rolling for initiative is an ordinary event roll, and
  all other rules such as proficiency bonuses apply. When a monster and a player roll the same initiative, players move
  first. Two players rolling the same initiative may either reach an agreement about who moves first or roll a d20 to
  decide, while monsters rolling the same initiative move in whatever order the storyteller decides.
</p>
<h5>Recognition</h5>
<p>Optionally, the DM may decide to ask players to roll for recognition to see the stats of the monsters they are about
  to fight. This normally includes their HP, AP, attributes, mitigation, and some of their spells, attacks, or
  abilities. This check depends on the survival skill and its DT is determined by the rarity of the monsters in
  question:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Monster Rarity</th>
    <th>Interpretation</th>
    <th>Typical DT</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Common</td>
    <td>The monster's physicalities are thoroughly documented in literature, and it is encountered by humans somewhat
      frequently.
    </td>
    <td>18</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rare</td>
    <td>The monster has been seen before, but not studied thoroughly. It may have been years to decades since the last
      sighting.
    </td>
    <td>24</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Legendary</td>
    <td>The monster has not been sighted in perhaps a century or more. Many doubt that it still exists, or ever existed.
    </td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exotic</td>
    <td>No human has ever seen the monster and lived to tell the tale.</td>
    <td>Impossible</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The recognition roll is normally made with disadvantage if the area is obscured by heavy fog or darkness. Conversely,
  players may roll with advantage if attempting to discern monsters that emit distinctive noises or smells. If
  successful, the players gain knowledge of the monster's HP, attacks, and mitigation stat, and any other information
  the {{dm}} chooses to reveal. If there are several monsters attacking together, the roll should be done in one
  go rather
  than rolling recognition separately for each unique type of monster in the encounter.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Sometimes, players may have a chance to view their enemies from a distance before
  they are recognized. In this case, they may roll for recognition before combat begins, possibly with advantage.
</p>
<h5>Surprise</h5>
<p>During an ambush or surprise attack, sometimes the defenders are so completely discombobulated that they are unable
  to react decisively. This condition is called <i>surprise</i> and has the following effects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Defenders cannot make recognition rolls</li>
  <li>Defenders make their initiative rolls with disadvantage.</li>
  <li>Defenders cannot take reactions until their first turn.</li>
  <li>Any attackers which move before <i>all</i> defenders may take part in a bonus combat round, giving them an extra
    chance to attack.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Surprise is triggered if the ambushing party succeeds a stealth check against the defending party. If the attackers
  have already succeeded a stealth check, they do not need to make an additional one. See <a
      href="../6_noncombat/c6.html#Sneaking">here</a> for more information on stealth tactics.
