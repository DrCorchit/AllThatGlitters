<p>Battles are usually represented in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A battlemap, with minis or markers representing the combatants</li>
  <li>A Virtual Tabletop (VTT)</li>
  <li>Theater of the Mind, with positioning described verbally by the DM</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks, but a physical battlemap offers the best experience in my
  opinion. Players have a visual and tactile representation of the battlefield, and there are no technical difficulties
  to worry about like websockets and port forwarding. The main downside of battlemaps is that they can become a bit
  expensive, and they only work for in-person sessions.
</p>
<p>When playing on a battlemap or a virtual tabletop, the battlefield is represented as a rectangular grid. Each tile is
  a six foot (or 2 meter) square, containing at most one combatant. Ordinarily, combatants can move or attack into any
  of these eight adjoining squares, unless the square is impassible or contains some sort of hazard.
</p>
<p>When playing without a battlemap, the DM verbally describes the layout of the battlefield, including the positioning
  of any hazards or attackers the characters can see. Players respond by describing their intended actions, or asking
  questions about what moves are or are not available. Combat proceeds in a similar way as when there is a battlemap,
  although complex positioning and tactics are not practically viable.
