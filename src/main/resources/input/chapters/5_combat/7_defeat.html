<p>When a monster or player character loses all their hitpoints, they can no longer fight and fall unconscious. What
  happens to a player character at this point depends on whether you are playing according to permadeath or modern
  rules.
</p>
<p>Under permadeath rules, downed players rolls a DT 12 {{skills.survival}} saving throw on their turn. After three
  saves, they become stable and do not need to make additional saves to stay alive. However, if a character accumulates
  three fails, they are dead and can only be revived by powerful resurrection magic. Under this system, players can be
  revived and resume fighting after being healed by any healing spell, as long as they have not actually died.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Under permadeath rules, rolling a natural 20 immediately causes the player to become
  stable.
</p>
<p>The modern rules offer an alternative system where unconscious players do not need to make saving throws to stay
  alive. However, they also do not regain consciousness after being healed by healing magic. Instead, they regain
  consciousness 1d4 hours after combat is over.
</p>
<p>In gameplay strategy, modern rules prioritize keeping the characters conscious, making single-target healing spells
  quite valuable. Permadeath rules favor mass healing spells that resurrect the character whenever they fall. You should
  think carefully about which system works best for you.
