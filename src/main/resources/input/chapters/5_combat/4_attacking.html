<p>The actions most commonly taken during a turn are those that deal damage. Attacks are handled in two parts, the first
  being an attack roll to determine whether the attack connects, and the second being a damage roll to determine how
  much damage is dealt. The attack roll is an ordinary skill check for martial arts (for melee), accuracy (for ranged),
  or other skills for the various schools of magic. The DT of the attack roll is the mitigation stat of the target.
</p>
<h5>Defending</h5>
<p>The defender can increase their mitigation temporarily by blocking (with an offhand action) or parrying (with a
  reaction). A few special rules apply to blocking and parrying:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to block and parry in the same turn. Blocking prevents parrying from being taken as a reaction.
  </li>
  <li>A defender can choose which attack to parry, but cannot choose to parry an attack after the attack roll for that
    attack has already been made.
  </li>
  <li>A defender can parry at most one attack per turn.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Damage</h5>
<p>To determine the damage of an attack that has connected, roll the weaponâ€™s damage dice and add your <a
    href="c3.html#modifier">modifier</a> for that weapon's attribute (usually strength). For example,
  if your character has 14 strength and attacks with a cutlass, you would roll the weapon's damage die (a d6) and add 4
  damage. If you rolled a 3, you would deal 7 damage: 3 from the die, and 4 from your strength modifier. To give another
  example, a pike has a damage die of 1d12 and either speed or strength may be used as its attribute. A character with
  12 strength and 14 speed would add their speed modifier to the polearm's damage die of 1d12. If they rolled an 8 on the
  1d12, they would deal a total of 12 damage: 8 from the die, and 4 from their speed modifier.
</p>
<p>Attack rules for spells are similar, but vary depend on the precise spell in question. Many spells partially or
  completely bypass ordinary mitigation or hit an entire area at once. In such cases, the target usually makes a saving
  throw to avoid full damage, rather than the caster trying to pass an ability check to cast the spell.
</p>
<h5><a id="Critical_Hits"></a>Critical Hits</h5>
<p>Not all attacks are created equal. Sometimes a blade strikes exceptionally true, piercing all defenses. When this
  happens, the blow is called a critical hit. Critical hits are triggered when the attacker rolls above the <i>critical
    threshold </i> (abbreviated CT) on the attack roll before any bonuses including proficiencies are applied. Normaly,
  the CT is 20, but certain bonuses lower the threshold, making it easier to score critical hits.
</p>
<p>When a critical hit lands, a few special rules apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The attack always connects, even if the enemy's MIT is higher than the total value rolled.</li>
  <li>The attack deals additional damage, gaining one bonus die for every damage die in the base attack.</li>
  <li>The first bonus die always takes its maximum value.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if a knight with 15 STR rolls a critical hit with a longsword, he would normally deal 5+1d10 damage. On
  a critical hit, he would roll 15+1d10 damage, because there is only one hit die, so the bonus die takes its maximum
  value. If a wizard rolled a critical hit with a spell dealing 3d8 damage, the spell would deal 8+5d8 damage, with 3d8
  being the base spell damage, 2d8 from bonus dice, and 8 from the bonus die taking maximum value.
