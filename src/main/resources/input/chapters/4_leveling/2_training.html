<p>It is possible for characters to proactively learn certain abilities from NPC trainers, such as skill proficiencies,
  combat tactics, and spells. In addition to any gold cost, learning abilities in this way costs training slots. Each
  player has training slots equal to their intelligence score, which represent the time and mental effort required to
  fully master the new skill. Most abilities consume 2 training slots at first, but that number is reduced by half every
  time the player levels up, rounded down. After leveling up, any trained abilities that consume only one training slot
  become rote abilities, and no longer consume training slots.
</p>
<p>If a player does not have enough training slots available to learn a new ability, they cannot learn the ability even
  if they have sufficient gold to purchase the training. In this case, players can choose to forget abilities they are
  in the process of learning. If this is done, the training slots for the forgotten ability are recovered but the gold
  use to purchase the ability is lost and the skill can no longer be used.
</p>
<p>In order to learn new abilities, players must first ensure that they meet the requirements of the ability they are
  trying to learn. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many abilities require a certain level of strength or intelligence, or other attribute.</li>
  <li>Some abilities require a level of proficiency in a certain skill.</li>
  <li>High level spells often require mastery of other low level spells before they can be learned.</li>
  <li>Players must have sufficient training slots available for the ability they are trying to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming they meet these requirements, players must find and hire a trainer of the appropriate discipline and skill
  level. After this, the new ability is gained, and can be used at any point in the adventure.
