<p>True to its name, All That Glitters treats looting as a core part of the leveling process. Besides the acquisition of

<ul>
  <li>Learning spells</li>
  <li>Hiring trainers</li>
  <li>Purchasing magical trinkets and jewelry</li>
  <li>Buying improved weapons and armor</li>
  <li>Buying potions, scrolls, or other tools</li>
</ul>
