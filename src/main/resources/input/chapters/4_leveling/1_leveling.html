<p>Each character’s skill as an adventurer is measured by their level, which typically begins at 1 and progresses up to
  20. Typically, all characters in the party level up together, usually after a huge battle or major obstacle is
  overcome. The DM increases the party's level after such milestones, recognizing the adventuring party’s increasing
  skill and renown.
</p>
<p>To level up, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look over the new class features you've gained, including any attribute or proficiency bonuses. Class features are
    covered <a href="c2.html#classes"> here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Increase your maximum hitpoints. Max HP is initially equal to your strength score and increases by half your
    strength score each level. If you leveled STR, you should recalculate your max hp:
    <pre>{{strings.max_hp_formula}}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you leveled instinct or charisma, increase your maximum willpower accordingly. Max WP is equal to 10 plus your
    instinct and charisma modifiers:
    <pre>{{strings.max_wp_formula}}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you leveled {{attr.INT}}, increase your maximum training slots:
    <pre>{{strings.training_slots_formula}}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Regain training slots. Any abilities trained in previous levels now use half as many training slots, rounded down.</li>
  <li>Update your character sheet. You don't need to copy new class abilities into the "abilities" section, but you
    should make sure that your attribute values and training slots are accurate. If your attributes changed, max HP, WP,
    and skill scores may also need to be updated, since they depend on your attributes.
  </li>
</ol>
