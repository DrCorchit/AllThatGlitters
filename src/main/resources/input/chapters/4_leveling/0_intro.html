<p>In All That Glitters, there are three ways that characters increase their power level: leveling, training, and
  looting. The main difference between these systems is that leveling provides guaranteed and predictable bonuses, while
  looting provides more irregular and chaotic bonuses that players cannot foresee. The bonuses from leveling promote
  planning and ambition, while the bonuses from looting are unique to each adventure, and promote character identity.
  Contrasting these, training allows players to take control of their own destinies and acquire the abilities they deem
  most useful.
