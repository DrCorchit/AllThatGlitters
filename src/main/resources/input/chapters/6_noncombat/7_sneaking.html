<p>Sneaking is handled through a {{skills.stealth}} ability check. The default roll required to evade detection is 10.
  The difficulty is affected by noise, lighting, and other circumstances, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Total Darkness: -5 to the DT</li>
  <li>Dim Lighting: 0 to the DT</li>
  <li>Bright Lighting: +10 to the DT</li>
  <li>Absolute Silence: +3 to the DT</li>
  <li>Light background noise: 0 to the DT</li>
  <li>Heavy background noise: -3 to the DT</li>
  <li>Obscuring fog or smoke, partial cover (such as a crowd): -3 to the DT</li>
  <li>Invisibility: -8 to DT. Lighting and obscurement have no further effect on the DT.</li>
  <li>Actively sought: The seeker's {{skills.perception}} modifier and proficiency are added to the DT.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, the DM may make additional adjustments as necessary.</p>
