<p>Merchants typically have a range of wares available for purchase. Some wares are common and available almost
  anywehre, while others are exceptionally rare and usually unique to a specific merchant. Commonly available items are
  listed in these locations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="appendix_weapons.html">Weapons</a></li>
  <li><a href="appendix_armor.html">Armor</a></li>
  <li><a href="appendix_items.html">Items</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Players can attempt to haggle merchants using the {{skills.persuasion}} skill. A merchant can be haggled up to three
  times, offering successively larger discounts if the player is able to pass increasingly difficulty persuasion checks.
  If the player fails any haggle, the merchant becomes obstinate and the discount for that item cannot be increased
  further. If the player fails to surpass DT 10 on a haggle, the merchant becomes irritated and removes all discounts
  completely.
</p>
<p>After attempting to haggle a merchant, the same merchant will not allow themselves to be haggled again for some time,
  unless they are fond of the adventuring party or from a culture where haggling is expected. The DM may impose
  situational bonuses or penalties to haggling accordingly.
