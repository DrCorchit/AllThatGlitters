<p>When traveling long distance overland, there are a number of concerns: travel time, food, water, bandits, weather,
  and road quality. Of these, food and bandits are the most troublesome.
</p>
<h5>Travel Time</h5>
<p>The amount of distance covered per day depends greatly on the physical fitness of the traveler, trail and weather
  conditions, and other factors such as mounts. A character's long distance hiking speed over even terrain is equal to
  half their speed score in feet per seconds. For a character with a speed score of 10, this is about 3.4 miles per
  hour. Players can travel at this speed for around 8 hours per day.
</p>
<p>25-30 miles is a reasonable distance for a party to cover per day, provided they follow established roads.
  When travelling over rough terrain (such as mountains or dense forests), this distance is halved.
</p>
<h5>Food</h5>
<p>The basic unit of food is the day's ration. Rations are presumed to consist of nonperishable supplies such as salted
  meat, pickled vegetables, or hardtack. Each adventurer consumes one ration per day. When rations run out, the party is
  either forced to hunt, which halves travel speed, or begins starvation.
</p>
<p>Starvation has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After day 3, the party can no longer recover during short rests.</li>
  <li>After day 5, the effect of a long rest is reduced to that of a short rest.</li>
  <li>After day 10, the party can no longer take rests. Skill checks are made with disadvantage.</li>
  <li>Starting on the 14th day, all attributes except speed are reduced by 1 each day. When strength reaches zero, the
    character perishes of hunger.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of starvation linger even after consuming rations. In the wilderness, characters recover 1 day of hunger
  every day they consume rations. In villages and towns, 3 days of hunger are recovered per day. It takes a bit more
  than one week to fully recover from the brink of starvation.
</p>
<h5>Bandits</h5>
<p>Bandits usually set up ambushes along minor trade routes and between cities, but shy away from the cities themselves
  and heavily travelled routes. Similarly, pirates roam the seas usually along trade routes. Naturally, all forms of
  banditry increase during wartime. Bandits and pirates behave differently depending on their class. Yokels and
  simpleton bandits usually kill their prey outright and loot their pockets. Professional bandits usually investigate
  their victims and attempt to discern if there is any chance of ransom. Pirates tend to sell their victims as slaves in
  foreign markets, while privateers tend to seek ransom.
</p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules for bandit encounters, but a rough understanding of their methods and techniques
  lends historical accuracy to the campaign.
