<p>Pickpocketing is a risky but potentially rewarding endeavor. To pickpocket, you roll for {{skills.sleight_of_hand}}
  while your mark (controlled by the DM) rolls for {{skills.perception}}. If your roll is higher than the mark's role,
  you successfully pick their pocket. Otherwise, they catch you with your hand in their pocket and act accordingly.
</p>
<p>There are special rules in certain occasions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the mark is in the middle of a crowd, engaged in deep conversation, or similarly distracted they have
    disadvantage on the perception roll.
  </li>
  <li>If the mark has their hands in their pockets, they have advantage on the perception roll.</li>
  <li>If you are intoxicated or one of your hands is restrained, you have disadvantage on the sleight of hand roll.
  </li>
  <li>If the city or location has a criminal reputation, the DT of the sleight of hand check is increased by 1d6.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When pickpocketing, different types of citizens usually have different amounts of money:</p>
