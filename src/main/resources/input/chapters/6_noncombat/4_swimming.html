<p>Whether above or under the water, movement speed is reduced by one half when swimming. A character with a speed
  score of 10 that normally moves at 5 ft/s would swim at 2.5 ft/s. It's possible to train swimming speed (Athletics
  Training: Freestyle), to bring swimming up to walking speed.

<p>Underwater, players can normally hold their breath for 10 seconds per point invested in the strength attribute, after
  which point they must pass a DT 10 willpower saving throw every ten seconds to avoid drowning. As with swimming speed,
  this can be improved with training (Athletics Training: Lung Capacity). The same rules apply when holding one's breath
  for other reasons, such as trying to avoid inhaling toxic fumes.
