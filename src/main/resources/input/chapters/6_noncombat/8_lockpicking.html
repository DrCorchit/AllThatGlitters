<p>Lockpicking is fairly straightforward. To pick a lock, the player must have at least one lockpick in their inventory.
  They roll a {{skills.sleight_of_hand}} check against the DT of the lock. If it fails, the lockpick is lost, but they
  may continue attempting to pick the lock if they have additional lockpicks. If successful, the lock is opened. Most
  locks have a DT of 12-15, but some may be as high as 20.
</p>
<p>Some special rules apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a guard is watching, you may have to roll for stealth while picking the lock. If you fail the stealth roll, you
    can continue picking the lock, but will have to deal with the consequences as the guard will notice your lawless
    behavior.
  </li>
  <li>If a lock is of an unusual make, the pick can break inside the lock rendering the lock unpickable. The DM should
    notify the player beforehand if this is likely to occur. The lockpick breaking inside the lock may also happen on a
    critical failure.
  </li>
  <li>Some locks may require two picks to be used at a time.</li>
</ul>
