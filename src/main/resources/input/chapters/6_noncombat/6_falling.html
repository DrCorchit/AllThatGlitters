<p>When making a standing jump, players can jump a number of feet equal to one half their speed score. If the player
  makes a running jump (or takes the move action prior to jumping while in combat), jump distance is equal to their
  speed score in feet. Jump height is always one half of standing jump distance. Both jump distance and jump height can
  be increased by athletics training.
</p>
<p>Damage from falling is determined by impact velocity, or how fast a character is moving when they hit the ground.
  When airborn, characters accelerate downward at roughly 30 feet per second per second, until they reach a maximal
  velocity due to air resistance. This means that fall damage increases the higher they fall until it reaches a maximum
  value. <a href="c2.html#Size">Larger characters</a> have a higher terminal velocity and therefore have a higher
  maximal fall damage.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fall damage type is always bludgeoning.</li>
  <li>Characters can take fall damage from sources other than falling, such as being hurled into a wall.</li>
  <li>Characters can choose to fall up to twice their terminal velocity by tucking in their limbs and maneuvering into a
    headfirst position, if so desired.
  </li>
  <li>Characters can take more damage than their terminal velocity if they are moving faster when they hit the ground.
    Characters in the air accelerate or decelerate as necessary until they reach their terminal velocity.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of determining fall damage, always round down the player's fall height or impact velocity to match
  the last row applicable.
