<p>Over time, your characters become ragged and weary as they take damage and expend AP during combat. Although some HP
  and AP can be recovered with potions or abilities, most recovery is done through resting. There are three kinds of
  rests:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Holiday</b>: The party spends several nights in or around a town, resting and relaxing or drinking and
    carousing as they will. All HP and AP are restored, and all status conditions are recovered. Holiday costs 10 gold
    per adventurer per night, and grants 1d6 temporary HP and 1d4 temporary WP. Players can reroll these dice up to
    three times by taking additional days on holiday.
  </li>
  <li><b>Night's Rest</b>: All HP and AP are restored. The entire party makes camp and sleeps for 8 hours, completing
    the adventuring day. If in the wilderness, this typically involves setting up camp, building a fire, cooking dinner,
    and so forth. In villages and towns, it usually involves a night at an inn. Taking a long rest consumes a day's
    rations, or 5 gold when resting at an inn. It's not possible to long rest inside certain areas, such as a fortress
    controlled by the enemy or a hostile wilderness or dungeon.
  </li>
  <li><b>Breather</b>: The party sits down for an hour or so to dress their wounds and catch their breath. Each player
    recovers 1d8 HP and 1d4 AP. This amount increases at higher levels, as follows:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Level</th>
        <th>HP recovered</th>
        <th>WP recovered</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1d8</td>
        <td>1d4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2d8</td>
        <td>1d6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>3d8</td>
        <td>1d8</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>4d8</td>
        <td>1d10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>5d8</td>
        <td>1d12</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    The party can take at most two breathers between long rests, possibly back to back.
