<p>There are two types of mounts: normal and huge. Normal mounts such as horses and camels generally carry one rider or
  a lightly loaded cart, and allow their rider to engage in melee combat. Huge mounts such as elephants can carry more
  riders and pull more weight, but render melee combat impossible. The following rules apply to both types of mounts,
  unless otherwise stated.
</p>
<h5>Mounted Combat</h5>
<p>During mounted combat, rider and mount have separate HP and willpower pools, and are targeted separately. The rider
  and mount share an initiative score and move and act together, but the mount does not take actions. Riders and mounts
  gain certain bonuses while moving. For these purposes, a mount is considered to be moving if it has moved in its
  previous or current turn.
</p>
<p>A number of special rules apply to mounted combat:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Neither riders nor mounts incur opportunity attacks.</li>
  <li>Riders have disadvantage on ranged attacks while moving. The "keshik" feat removes this penalty.
  </li>
  <li>Riders of huge mounts cannot make melee attacks, and cannot be melee attacked.</li>
  <li>Melee attacks against riders have disadvantage. If the mount is moving, melee attacks against it also have
    disadvantage.
  </li>
  <li>Attackers with polearms do not suffer disadvantage when attacking riders or mounts, and can make opportunity
    attacks against mounts.
  </li>
  <li>The hitpoints of a mount are equal to twice its strength score.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Pace and Speed</h5>
<p>When riding a mount, a player's movement speed is replaced with the speed of their mount. Mounts travel at one of
  four paces: walk, trot, canter, or gallop. At a walking pace, a mount's speed (in tiles per turn) is one quarter of
  its {{attr.SPD}} attribute. For a typical riding horse, this is around 4 miles per hour. A mount can walk comfortably
  for up to eight hours without suffering from exhaustion, even while carrying a rider or pulling a cart (over level
  terrain). This is the ideal pace for long distances, but unremarkable for combat.
</p>
<p>A mount (not the rider) can expend 1 willpower to increase its pace, doubling its movement speed each level.</p>

<p>These speeds apply to mounts which are carrying a single rider or a cart with a light load. When an unladen and
  unmounted animal moves, it expends half as much willpower when trotting or galloping. Conversely, a mount carrying two
  riders or a heavy load must expend twice as much willpower in order to trot, and cannot canter or gallop.
</p>
<h5>Additional Rules</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A player can mount a rideable feral animal by passing a DT 18 {{skills.nature}} check. Failing the check, the
    rider must make a DT 12 {{attr.STR}} saving throw or be thrown off. The rider can continue to make checks until they
    succeed or are thrown off.
  </li>
  <li>When a mount dies, the rider is thrown from its back and must make a DT 16 {{skills.mobility}} check or else fall
    prone and lose all actions on their next turn.
  </li>
  <li>Mounts can have levels, which affect their max HP and recovery during breathers. A mount's level is determined by
    the DM, and can increase alongside that of its rider.
  </li>
  <li>A mount can pull weight equal to its deadlift weight as determined by its strength score. A mount can pull up to
    twice this weight as a heavy load.
  </li>
  <li>The storyteller may adapt any of these rules to accommodate fantasy mounts such as dragons or pegasi. Such
    adaptations should be made known to players in advance to avoid confusion.
  </li>
