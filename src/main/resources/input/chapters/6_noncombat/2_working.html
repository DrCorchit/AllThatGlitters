<p>At times, players may decide to earn money by plying various trades. Each trade pays a certain amount on a daily
  basis, sometimes dependent on one or more skill checks. However, adventurers are not particularly fond of regular
  work, and therefore rarely take such jobs for more than a month. One the occasions where they do take such jobs, the
  pay is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Farming &amp; Manual Labor</b>: Pay is low, but honest. A player who engages in this sort of activity earns 3
    gold per day.
  </li>
  <li><b>Guarding</b>: Offers higher pay than other unskilled jobs at 5 gold per day. If the players are directly
    attacked while guarding, they roll for {{skills.defense}} to handle the situation. If not, the DM may have the
    players roll for {{skills.perception}}. If the players fail to observe a crime that was committed, they may be
    docked a day's pay or dismissed from guard duty. Players should roll for these events roughly once for every week of
    guard duty.
  </li>
  <li><b>Performing</b>: At most one player can take this job per tavern per night. The base pay depends on the player's
    {{skills.performance}} roll: Below 16: 1 gold. At or above 16: 1d10 gold. On a critical success, the player earns
    1d20 gold. If the player has master level performance, the roll is made with advantage. If performing for more than
    a few nights, the player can take the average of three nights as their daily pay.
  </li>
  <li><b>Hunting &amp; Fishing</b>: Player engaged in this activity make a DT 15 {{skills.survival}} check. On a
    success, they acquire enough fish, fowl, or game to feed themselves and one other player for one night. On a
    critical success, they feed the entire party. If near a town, the quarry can instead be sold for 10 or 20 gold,
    respectively. If attempted in an inhospitable environment, the DM may impose disadvantage or forbid hunting
    altogether.
  </li>
  <li><b>Transcribing</b>: If there is an employer hiring for this type of work, the player may be able to take
    employment as a scribe. The player must be at least proficient in literacy and also pass a DT 15 {{skills.literacy}}
    check to convince the employer that they are suitable for this type of work. If successful, they may work as a
    scribe for some time, transcribing dictations, copying manuscripts, and the like. Pay is 5 gold per day.
  </li>
  <li><b>Healing</b>: The base pay depends on a {{skills.medicine}} check. On a critical fail, the player earns no money
    and cannot continue to practice medicine. Below 12, and the pay is 1 gold. 12 or above, and the pay is 1d8. On a
    critical success, pay is 1d20. If healing for more than a few days, the player can take the average of three days as
    their daily pay.
  </li>
</ul>
