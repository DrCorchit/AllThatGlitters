<h4>Weapon Modifiers</h4>
<p>Certain weapons have special properties, which affect how they behave:
<ul>
	<li><b>Cut-and-Thrust</b>: The item can deal either piercing or slashing damage.</li>
	<li><b>Parrying</b>: The weapon allows the parry reaction, increasing mitigation by the indicated amount.</li>
	<li><b>Blocking</b>: The weapon increases BC by a certain amount, doubled when actively blocking.</li>
	<li><b>Mordhau</b>: The weapon can be held by the blade, using the crossguard as a hammer. This changes the weapon’s
		damage type to bludgeoning, and replaces the damage die. (Larger swords have this property.)
	</li>
	<li><b>Versatile</b>: The weapon can be held in a two-handed grip for extra damage.</li>
	<li><b>Nimble</b>: Dexterity can be used to augment the weapon’s damage, instead of strength.</li>
	<li><b>Improvised</b>: The item is not designed as a weapon. The damage die is rolled with disadvantage.</li>
	<li><b>Light</b>: The weapon can be used with a greatshield, or dual-wielded alongside another light weapon. (All
		small weapons have this property.)
	</li>
	<li><b>Sharp</b>: The critical threshold for the weapon is reduced by 1.</li>
	<li><b>Reach</b>: The weapon can hit targets 10 feet away, instead of 5. (All polearms have this property.)</li>
	<li><b>Throwable</b>: The weapon deals full damage when thrown.</li>
	<li><b>Projectile</b>: The weapon fires a specific type of projectile.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Small Weapons</h4>
<p>Such weapons are those which are easily wielded in one hand, including small everyday tools improvised as weapons.
	They require no especial skill to use, are easily concealed, and are typically wielded by civilians. These weapons
	automatically have the light property, and can be dual-wielded or used in the offhand.

<h4>Ranged Weapons</h4>
<p>Weapons designed to be thrown or to launch a projectile. Projectile weapons are divided into three categories: drawn
	bows, crossbows, and firearms. Of these, only those with the <i>light</i> property may be operated with one hand.
	All others require two hands to operate effectively. Drawn bows and thrown weapons possess the <i>nimble</i>
	property, and may deal damage with either strength or dexterity. Firearms and crossbows deal flat damage that does
	not depend on any attribute.
