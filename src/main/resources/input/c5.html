<p>Combat is pure chaos. It's nothing like the movies; you won't find any choreographed fencing with somersaults and
  pirouettes, dramatic music, or witty banter. Real combat is full of noise and blood and grime, broken bones, and the
  screams of the dying—or the eerie silence of the dead. Be that as it may, mortal combat is actually the most advanced
  form problem-solving on a great many worlds. So you'd better get good at it.
</p>
<p>In order to make sense out of chaos, the battlefield is represented with a grid and time is divided into <i>turns</i>
  and <i> rounds</i>. Each grid square represents a 5-by-5 foot square of terrain, while a turn of combat captures a
  single fighter doing their best to kill and not be killed for a single 5-second snapshot of time. Finally, a round is
  completed when all combatants have completed their turn. Once combat has started, it continues through as many rounds
  as it needs to until only one faction remains, and all others have either surrendered, fled, or been slain. Then it
  ends, as quickly as it began.
</p>
<h4>The Battlefield</h4>
<p>Battles are usually represented in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A battlemap, with minis or markers representing the combatants</li>
  <li>A Virtual Tabletop (VTT)</li>
  <li>Theater of the Mind, with positioning described verbally by the DM</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks. A battlemap is visual and tactile, and it takes your eyes
  away from the phone screen. There's no debugging websockets or port forwarding nonsense. That said, VTTs can present a
  great experience, especially if the game is played through a video call. The main downside of VTTs is the time it
  takes to setup the battlefield. However, this can be reduced if the DM has been able to plan the encounter in advance.
  Finally, theater of the mind is the cheapest and fastest option. The downside is that battles with complex positioning
  become impossible, and you can't actually see your characters in any sort of visual form. In my opinion, the best
  experience comes from a physical battlemap with actual minis, provided you are able to meet in person.
</p>
<h4>Beginning the Fight</h4>
<h5>Initiative</h5>
<p>Combat begins with a skill check, as both players and npc combatants roll for initiative. Initiative determines move
  order, with higher scores moving first. In <i>All That Glitters</i>, rolling for initiative is an ordinary event roll,
  and all other rules such as proficiency bonuses apply. When a monster and a player roll the same initiative, players
  move first. Two players rolling the same initiative may either reach an agreement about who moves first or roll a d20
  to decide, while monsters rolling the same initiative move in whatever order the DM decides.
</p>
<h5>Recognition</h5>
<p>Optionally, the DM may decide to allow players to roll for recognition to see the stats of the monsters they are
  about to fight. This normally includes their HP, AP, attributes, mitigation, and some of their abilities. This check
  depends on the survival skill and its DT is determined by the rarity of the monsters in question:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Monster Rarity</th>
    <th>Interpretation</th>
    <th>Typical DT</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Common</td>
    <td>The monster's physicalities are thoroughly documented in literature, and its attacks are an (at least) annual
      occurance.
    </td>
    <td>18</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rare</td>
    <td>The monster has been seen before, but not studied thoroughly. It may have been years to decades since the last
      sighting.
    </td>
    <td>24</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Legendary</td>
    <td>The monster has not been sighted in perhaps a century or more. Many doubt that it still exists, or ever existed.
    </td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The recognition roll is normally made with disadvantage if the area is obscured by heavy fog or darkness. Conversely,
  players may roll with advantage if attempting to discern monsters that emit distinctive noises or smells. If
  successful, the players gain knowledge of the monster's HP, attacks, and mitigation stat, and any other information
  the DM chooses to reveal. If there are several monsters attacking together, the roll should be done in one go rather
  than rolling recognition separately for each unique type of monster in the encounter.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Sometimes, players may have a chance to view their enemies from a distance before
  they are recognized. In this case, they may roll for recognition before combat begins, possibly with advantage.
</p>
<h5>Surprise</h5>
<p>During an ambush or surprise attack, sometimes the defenders are so completely discombobulated that they are unable
  to react decisively. This condition is called <i>surprise</i> and has the following effects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Defenders cannot make recognition rolls</li>
  <li>Defenders make their initiative rolls with disadvantage.</li>
  <li>Defenders cannot take reactions until their first turn.</li>
  <li>Any attackers which move before <i>all</i> defenders may take part in a bonus combat round, giving them an extra
    chance to attack.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Surprise is triggered if the ambushing party succeeds a stealth check against the defending party. If the attackers
  have already succeeded a stealth check, they do not need to make an additional one. See <a href="c6.html#Sneaking">here</a>
  for more information on stealth tactics.
</p>
<h4><a id="Actions"></a>Actions</h4>
<p>At the beginning of every combat turn, players gain one main hand action, one offhand action, and movement points
  equal to their speed attribute. The various actions taken during the turn deplete these resources until the player has
  no more abilities to use, at which point their turn ends. Monsters may have more or fewer actions than human players,
  but otherwise their combat turns proceed in essentially the same way.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Some combat actions, such as a two-handed weapon attack, use both the main hand and
  offhand action.
</p>
<h4><a id="Reacting"></a>Reacting</h4>
<p>Reactions are moves a character makes in response to specific triggers, such as an enemy moving into or out of melee
  range. Characters use reactions before their turn starts, and normally may make one reaction per turn. Common examples
  of reactions include parrying, blocking with a shield, and opportunity attacks.
</p>
<p>For example, if a player is engaged in melee combat with a monster that turns and runs away, the player can make a
  reaction called an opportunity attack. The opportunity attack allows the player to make a main hand (or two handed)
  weapon attack against the monster outside the player's normal turn. Most monsters are also capable of scoring
  opportunity attacks against players, but players can use the disengage action to avoid this. Disengage allows the
  player to move out of melee range without triggering the opportunity attack reaction, useful for repositioning.
</p>
<p>The following chart displays some actions and reactions typically available to players:</p>

  <tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Cost</th>

<h4><a id="Attacking"></a>Attacking</h4>
<p>The actions most commonly taken during a turn are those that deal damage. Attacks are handled in two parts, the first
  being an attack roll to determine whether the attack connects, and the second being a damage roll to determine how
  much damage is dealt. The attack roll is an ordinary skill check for martial arts (for melee), accuracy (for ranged),
  or sorcery (for spells). The DT of the attack roll is the mitigation stat of the target.
</p>
<h5>Defending</h5>
<p>The defender can increase their mitigation temporarily by blocking (with an offhand action) or parrying (with a
  reaction). A few special rules apply to blocking and parrying:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to block and parry in the same turn. Blocking prevents parrying from being taken as a reaction.
  </li>
  <li>A defender can choose which attack to parry, but cannot choose to parry an attack after the attack roll for that
    attack has already been made.
  </li>
  <li>A defender can parry at most one attack per turn.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Damage</h5>
<p>To determine the damage of an attack that has connected, roll the weapon’s damage dice and add your <a
    href="c3.html#ASM">attribute score modifier</a> (ASM) for that weapon's attribute (usually strength). For example,
  if your character has 14 strength and attacks with a cutlass, you would roll the weapon's damage die (a d6) and add 4
  damage. If you rolled a 3, you would deal 7 damage: 3 from the die, and 4 from your strength ASM. To give another
  example, a pike has a damage die of 1d12 and either speed or strength may be used as its attribute. A character with
  12 strength and 14 speed would add their speed ASM to the polearm's damage die of 1d12. If they rolled an 8 on the
  1d12, they would deal a total of 12 damage: 8 from the die, and 4 from their speed ASM.
</p>
<p>Attack rules for spells are similar, but vary depend on the precise spell in question. Many spells partially or
  completely bypass ordinary mitigation or hit an entire area at once. In such cases, the target usually makes a saving
  throw to avoid full damage, rather than the caster trying to pass an ability check to cast the spell.
</p>
<h5><a id="Critical_Hits"></a>Critical Hits</h5>
<p>Not all attacks are created equal. Sometimes a blade strikes exceptionally true, piercing all defenses. When this
  happens, the blow is called a critical hit. Critical hits are triggered when the attacker rolls above the <i>critical
    threshold </i> (abbreviated CT) on the attack roll before any bonuses including proficiencies are applied. Normaly,
  the CT is 20, but certain bonuses lower the threshold, making it easier to score critical hits.
</p>
<p>When a critical hit lands, a few special rules apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The attack always connects, even if the enemy's MIT is higher than the total value rolled.</li>
  <li>The attack deals additional damage, gaining one bonus die for every damage die in the base attack.</li>
  <li>The first bonus die always takes its maximum value.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if a knight with 15 STR rolls a critical hit with a longsword, he would normally deal 5+1d10 damage. On
  a critical hit, he would roll 15+1d10 damage, because there is only one hit die, so the bonus die takes its maximum
  value. If a wizard rolled a critical hit with a spell dealing 3d8 damage, the spell would deal 8+5d8 damage, with 3d8
  being the base spell damage, 2d8 from bonus dice, and 8 from the bonus die taking maximum value.
</p>
<h4><a id="Moving"></a>Moving</h4>
<p>At the start of their turn, characters gain movement points equal to half their speed attribute score. When moving
  around on a rectangular battle grid, players expend 1 movement point for every vertical, horizontal, or diagonal move.
  Optionally, players can opt to use fractional movement points. Under this system, diagonal movement costs 1.5 movement
  points, effectively making the set of reachable tiles more circular. This also makes odd movement points more
  relevant, but increases the complexity of maneuvering. In any case, a character cannot enter a tile unless they have
  the required amount of movement points remaining. For example, a character with 5.5 movement points would be able to
  move at most 5 tiles horizontally or vertically.
</p>
<p>In a 5-second combat round with 5-foot square tiles, a speed of 10 (average) translates to 5 feet per second, or
  around 3.5 miles per hours. This implies a typical jog speed of 7 miles per hour, and a sprint speed of 14 miles per
  hours.
</p>
<h4><a id="Grappling"></a>Grappling</h4>
<p>A player can attempt to grapple an enemy by using both a main and offhand action. The attacker and the defender then
  both roll a martial arts skill check, with the grapple succeeding if the attacker's score is greater than or equal to
  the defender's score. Once grappled, the defender cannot move or take main or offhand actions during their turn.
  However, they can reroll their martial arts check once each turn, until their score is higher than the score rolled by
  the attacker. At this point, they are no longer grappled and will be able to move and act normally on their next turn.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Relative size affects grappling chances, as follows: If a character attempts to
  grapple an enemy that is smaller than themselves, they gain advantage on the martial arts check. If they attempt to
  grapple an enemy larger than themselves, they gain disadvantage. No character may grapple a character more than one
  size class larger than they are.
</p>
<p>During a grapple, a few special rules take effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The DC of both combatants is reduced to zero, lowering their MIT.</li>
  <li>The grappled character's BC is added to the attacker's BC.</li>
  <li>The grappled character acts as a meatshield, taking full damage from failed attacks against the grappling
    character.
  </li>
  <li>A character can attempt to break an ally free from being grappled by using the help action. In this case, both
    characters roll for martial arts. If either roll is higher than the grappler's martial arts roll, the grapple
    condition ends.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If a player is grappling an enemy at the start of their turn, their moveset is restricted to the following actions:
</p>
<p><b>Dragging</b>: The character moves at half speed, bringing the grappled foe along with them.</p>
<p><b>Throwing</b> costs a main and offhand action. The player makes a strength check with a DT equal to the enemy's
  strength score. If successful, the throw distance is 5 feet plus an additional foot for every point their strength
  check exceeded the enemy's strength score.
</p>
<p><b>Regrappling</b> costs a main and offhand action and allows the grappler to reroll the initial martial arts check
  of the grapple with advantage, potentially increasing the DT of the defender's check to break free on subsequent
  turns. However, if the new grapple score is lower than the defender's original grapple score, the defender immediately
  breaks free from the grapple. Regrappling is mainly useful if the attacker's initial grapple score was lower than
  expected, and the defender is likely to break out on future turns.
</p>
<p><b>Releasing</b> an enemy costs no effort, and the grappler can move and attack as normal on their turn. They will
  have to pass another martial arts check to grapple the enemy again, but have advantage on attack rolls against the
  same creature.
</p>
<h4><a id="Defeat"></a>Defeat</h4>
<p>When a monster or player character loses all their hitpoints, they can no longer fight and fall unconscious. What
  happens to a player character at this point depends on whether you are playing according to permadeath or modern
  rules.
</p>
<p>Under permadeath rules, once the player has been downed they roll a d20 every time it is their turn in combat. Every
  roll of a 10 or higher is considered a save, while every roll of 9 or lower is considered a fail. If the character
  makes three saves, they become stable and do not need to make additional saves to stay alive. However, if a character
  accumulates three fails, they are dead and can only be revived by powerful resurrection magic. Under this system,
  players can be revived and resume fighting after being healed by any healing spell, as long as they have not actually
  died.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Under permadeath rules, rolling a natural 20 immediately causes the player to become
  stable.
</p>
<p>The modern rules offer an alternative system where unconscious players do not need to make saving throws to stay
  alive. However, they also do not regain consciousness after being healed by healing magic. Instead, they regain
  consciousness 1d4 hours after combat is over.
</p>
<p>In gameplay strategy, modern rules prioritize keeping the characters conscious, making single-target healing spells
  quite valuable. Permadeath rules favor mass healing spells that resurrect the character whenever they fall. You should
  think carefully about which system works best for you.
</p><a id="Damage_Types"></a>
<h4>Damage Types</h4>
<p>Smashing, slashing, poisoning, burning… There are quite a few ways to do someone in. Here's a list of damage types
  and their unique effects:
</p>
<h5>Common Damage Types:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Slashing</b>: Liable to cause bleeding.</li>
  <li><b>Bludgeoning</b>: +3 to hit versus plate armors.</li>
  <li><b>Piercing</b>: +3 to hit versus mail armors.</li>
  <li><b>Fire</b>: Liable to cause burning.</li>
  <li><b>Poisoning</b>: Deals additional effects, depending on the type of poison.</li>
  <li><b>Force</b>: Dealt from explosions. Liable to knock the target prone.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Rare Damage Types:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ice</b>: Liable to cause freezing.</li>
  <li><b>Lightning</b>: Voids BC from metal armor.</li>
  <li><b>Corrosive</b>: Causes armor damage which must later be repaired at a smithy.</li>
  <li><b>Holy</b>: An extraordinarily bright light causes extra damage to undead and evil aligned creatures.</li>
  <li><b>Profane</b>: A sickening miasma of spiritual darkness causes extra damage to good-aligned creatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notes on damage types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slashing, fire, and ice damage deal one level of their respective status effects per hit.</li>
  <li>When a character takes force damage exceeding their strength score, they must make a strength saving throw with DT
    equal to the force damage dealt or be knocked prone.
  </li>
  <li>Successful attacks with acid decrease the target's BC by 1, until zero. The armor can be repaired at a blacksmith
    for 20 gold per BC lost.
  </li>
  <li>Good-aligned characters possess resistance to holy damage, and vulnerability to profane damage. Conversely,
    evil-aligned characters and the undead possess resistance to profane damage and vulnerability to holy damage.
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Vulnerability, Resistance, and Immunity</h5>
<p>Vulnerability, resistance, and immunity affect the damage from specific damage types, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Vulnerability</b>: Damage is doubled.</li>
  <li><b>Resistance</b>: Damage is halved.</li>
  <li><b>Immunity</b>: Damage is voided.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Status_Effects"></a>Status Effects</h4>
<p>Sometimes characters fall prey to certain temporary conditions that reduce their effectiveness in combat. These
  conditions are called status effects and begin and end under certain conditions. Also, some status effects can
  accumulate, meaning they can be inflicted multiple times on the same character.
