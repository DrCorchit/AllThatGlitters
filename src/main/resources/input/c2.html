<p>Now that you know the basics, you're ready to create a character. This section of the text will refer to some
	mechanics which aren't explained until later sections. If that bothers you, you can skip ahead to later chapters and
	revisit this section later. However, you don't need to perfectly understand the rules to make an excellent
	character. I recommend at least a quick read of this chapter before moving on.
</p>
<p>Creating a character in <i>All That Glitters</i> is really simple. Just follow these steps:</p>

<h4><a id="Choosing_a_Race"></a>Races</h4>
<p>There are eight example races here, representing some favorite repeat offenders from the fantasy genre. That said,
	homebrewing new races is very much in the spirit of All that Glitters, and if a race you want to play isn’t in this
	list, you absolutely should create it. Alternatively, feel free to create your own lore for any of these races—don’t
	let my ideas stifle yours! Further on, I’ll explain some guidelines for creating new races while also respecting
	gameplay balance.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Human"></a>
<h5>Human</h5>
<p>Overall, humans are proud, robust, and athletic. I daresay we are altogether quite handsome. Men average around 5’9”
	in height; women around 5’4”. Weight varies greatly, usually between 100-200 lbs. We live between 70 and 90 years,
	if we do not die in one of our many wars.
</p>
<p>Although we humans may seem an uninspiring choice to some, it’s all a matter of perspective. To dwarves, we are tall
	and regal. To elves, we are robust and warlike. Among saurids, we are called slow and loud. And so it goes.
</p>
<p>Human characters start with a single bonus point in an ability of their choice, and may take a level of proficiency
	in any skill. Humans are well suited to any class.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Elf"></a>
<h5>Elf</h5>
<p>Graceful and elegant, elves exemplify much of what humans aspire to be. In height, male elves average about 6’3”;
	female elves about 5’9”. Weight varies between 120-200 lbs. They are barely heavier than humans, despite their
	increased stature. The gods have truly blessed their race: they live around 200 years at least, and some (of the
	royal line) as long as five hundred.
</p>
<p>Over time, their kind has diverged into three bloodlines. Descendants of the royal bloodline are called Eldarii and
	excel in magic and all manner of letters. They incorporate magic into nearly every level of society. As a
	consequence, even their young children know basic spells. They are invariably blonde haired and fair skinned, and
	persistently arrogant. Some of them attempt to repent their hubris, but I have come to prefer the frank honesty of
	arrogance to a feigned humility.
</p>
<p>Members of the common line are called Numenarii, and pursue archery, hunting, fishing, and farming. They have
	interbred on occasion with humans, and so take on darker hair and skin tones. They imitate the arrogance of the
	Eldarii, though it is but a veneer: they are quite insecure.
</p>
<p>Members of the third bloodline are called Drow, and are descended from the line of the nameless usurper. Tales of
	their cruelty are exaggerated, but not by much. Their skin is bluish gray, and their hair silver. They do not spare
	themselves from their own ruthless designs, and many attempt to escape their subterranean holds. Those few who do
	often become brave adventurers.
</p>
<p>All elven characters suffer a -1 penalty to strength, and gain bonuses depending on their bloodline. Those of the
	royal line gain +2 INT and knowledge of a level 1 spell, plus proficiency in literacy, along with deficiency in
	survival. Members of the common line gain +2 DEX and proficiency in nature and accuracy. Drow gain +2 WILL and
	proficiency in perception and stealth. Drow also have the gift of darkvision.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Dwarf"></a>
<h5>Dwarf</h5>
<p>A short and ruddy race. Male dwarves average around 5 feet in height, while their females average around 4’8”.
	Despite their stature, they weigh between 100-160 lbs. It is customary for their men to grow long beards, though
	beards longer than twenty inches are seldom seen outside storybooks. They live a bit longer than humans, so a
	century and a half is not out of the question.
</p>
<p>The dwarves of yore possessed insatiable bloodthirst and fought man, elf, and dragon alike in a great many wars.
	Times have changed, and they have been at peace nigh on two millennia. They are now greatly concerned with the
	exploration of mountains and caves, the industry of mining, and the acquisition of gold.
</p>
<p>Despite their unusual habits and short stature, dwarves are actually a fairly well balanced race that can excel in
	many roles. Dwarves gain +1 STR and +1 WILL at the cost of -2 SPD, and choose an additional +1 in STR or WILL. Also,
	dwarves have a keen sense for gold and have advantage on perception and persuasion checks when searching for
	treasure or bartering with merchants. All dwarves have proficiency in defense. Dwarves make particularly fearsome
	warriors, but are a solid choice in many other roles.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Halfling"></a>
<h5>Halfling</h5>
<p>The shortest of the races, halfling men average 3’9” in height. Their women are yet shorter, scantly 3’6” by average.
	A tall halfling may resemble a short dwarf, though the former will be discernible by his slender build and wispy
	facial hair, if he has any at all. Halflings weigh only 50-100 lbs, and I’ll wager a drink you can’t find a heavier
	one in under a fortnight. They are somewhat long lived, often lasting a bit more than a century.
</p>
<p>As timeless as their quaint and cozy country villages may seem, they are no strangers to change. Nearly half of them
	are now second or third generation immigrants in large cities. They are unwelcome there on account of their ill
	reputation: it is said that nearly a third of them are criminals. As thieves, they are exceedingly sly.
</p>
<p>Halflings tend to be unbalanced characters, having a -2 penalty to STR and a -2 penalty to SPD. They make up for this
	with a +2 to DEX, and another +2 to INT, CHA, or WILL. Urban halflings start with proficiency in parkour and sleight
	of hand, while rural halflings start with proficiency in nature and survival. They excel as mages, zealots, and
	renegades, but struggle as warriors.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Orc"></a>
<h5>Orc</h5>
<p>Stout and rippling with muscle, orcs are warriors to the last. Their menfolk are nearly as tall as the elves, around
	6’, and their women are barely any shorter, around 5’10”. Fully grown, they weigh somewhere between 180 to 300
	lbs—quite formidable! Their hair is almost invariably black or gray, while their skin ranges from dark green to pale
	yellow or gray. In years, they may reach 60 if they are lucky; usually less. They make up for this by living with
	what I will graciously call ‘extreme vigor’.
</p>
<p>The history of orcs is full of long and bloody intertribal conflicts. Despite this, they have made steady progress as
	a species and have transitioned from cave dwellings to small villages, then larger villages, until now many think to
	mingle with humans, dwarves, and halflings on the frontiers of civilization. (Elves will have none of their ilk.)
	They are well-suited to mercenary or guard work. They make poor thieves or wizards.
</p>
<p>Orcs gain +2 to STR and WILL, at the cost of -1 to DEX and -1 INT, and an addional -1 to either INT or CHA. They have
	proficiency in intimidation and survival.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Tiefling"></a>
<h5>Tiefling</h5>
<p>Of middling stature and musculature, tieflings are nearly human. Yet as the saying goes, ‘so close and yet so far.’
	By virtue of their debauched bloodline (the devil-dealings of their ancestors being no small secret) they are cursed
	with horns, pointed ears, and skin of a blood-red hue (or other outrageous colors). Almost everywhere, they are
	shunned by all ‘good’ folk. Yet I think they can be accorded a little understanding, for they are neither warlike
	nor pompous, and wisely take their poor lot in life with a dose of good humor.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to give a straightforward account of their physical nature, because it is so widely varied. I have
	seen some as short as 5’ and others as tall as 6’8”. Their are neither particularly bulky nor slender, and so their
	weight is comparable to that of a human. Only in longevity have the gods relented, granting them perhaps 110 years,
	around the same span as a halfling.
</p>
<p>Tieflings typically live in colonies suitably removed from human and elven settlements. They have dealings with
	dwarves and halflings, who treat them fairly. They quietly pursue industry and keep to themselves, but their young
	oft grow weary of their meek ways and seek adventure and companionship abroad.
</p>
<p>Tieflings gain +1 to CHA and DEX, and an additional +1 to INT or CHA, at the cost of -2 WILL. They possess the gift
	of darkvision, and can see in total darkness to a range of 3 yards, or dim light to about 30 yards. They have
	proficiency in performance and either medicine or perception.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Aarakocra"></a>
<h5>Aarakocra</h5>
<p>Flighty and covered with feathers, the Aarakocra are an extremely vibrant and colorful race. There are as many
	sub-races of these as of man or elf; it seems that many take after some species of bird or another. So you have one
	with feathers of azure and gold, another crimson, cream, and jade, and a third black as a raven. In general, they
	are about the size of a man, but extraordinarily light. I think 5'6" is a typical height, but they weigh less than
	80 pounds. Their longevity varies greatly, and some have a span of up to 250 years, rivaling even the elves.
	However, this is not common and I have met very few over the age of ninety or so.
</p>
<p>On my travels, I have observed that Aarakocra races and tribes can be roughly divided into two categories: raptors
	and songbirds. The former are taller and stronger, and possess extremely keen hearing and sight. As for the
	songbirds, they are extremely quick with their limbs and can mimic almost any sound they hear. They have a
	reputation for bing tricksters, and are in the habit of gathering shiny things, as their brothers the ravens and
	crows do.
</p>
<p>Aarakocra gain a +2 bonus to SPD, but -2 to STR. All aarakocra can glide and are immune to fall damage. Raptors gain
	+1 STR and proficiency in perception, while songbirds gain +1 DEX and proficiency in performance.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Saurid"></a>
<h5>Saurid</h5>
<p>Slinking, skulking, scurrying—these are words befitting a saurid. Treading the slender line between man and beast,
	they are a fierce folk. As much lizard as man, they possess scaly hides, long tails, and snouts lined with razor
	sharp teeth. Some say they are cruel, but having observed them closely on more than one occasion, I would rather
	describe them as practical.
</p>
<p>A saurid is typically shorter than a man, but they grow all their lives until old age. Some can become quite large.
	Their females are a bit taller and more muscular than their males. In terms of height, they reach about 5’6” while
	the male might reach only 5’2 or so. They are not long-lived, and seventy years is a ripe age for a saurid.
</p>
<p>The saurids I have seen are fairly xenophobic, and live in colonies inside caves usually near water. They hunt, fish,
	and raise their hatchlings quietly, having few dealings with man or elf, except for the occasional territorial
	clash. They have developed a unique sort of architecture, and their colonies are quite remarkable, often lavishly
	decorated with precious stones and cut stone. Their predilection for gathering all things shiny has attracted
	dwarven traders, which has brought the common tongue to their knowledge. Many of them now seek adventure abroad,
	bringing with them their fearsome and curious ways.
</p>
<p>Saurids gain +2 to STR and SPD, at the cost of -2 INT and -1 CHA. They possess the gift of darkvision, able to see in
	near total darkness. They have deficiency in literacy, but may take proficiency in two out of initiative, stealth,
	or perception.
</p>
<h5>Custom Races</h5>
<p>When creating new races, consider following these general guidelines:</p>
<ol>
	<li>No stat bonus should exceed +2, and no stat penalty should exceed -2.</li>
	<li>The sum of all attribute bonuses minus all penalties should equal 1.</li>
	<li>Every race should have at least one proficiency bonus, but no more than 2.</li>
	<li>Ideally, the player should have some choices regarding either subraces, attributes, or proficiencies.</li>
	<li>Be careful making races that give +2 bonuses to both strength and dexterity, or both intelligence and will. Such
		races make very strong warriors or wizards respectively with very little downside.
	</li>
</ol>
<h5><a id="Size"></a>Size</h5>
<p>A character's race also determines their size. Size is not recorded on the character sheet, but is usually medium. If
	you picked a halfling, it's small. Size primarily affects what weapons a character can and can’t use, terminal
	velocity, and how effectively they can grapple. Grappling will be explained in further detail in <a
			href="c5.html#Grappling">chapter 5</a>, while fall damage and terminal velocity will be explained in <a
			href="c6.html#Falling">chapter 6</a>.

<h4><a id="Choosing_a_Class"></a>Classes</h4>
<div class="row">
	<div class="column">
		<p>A character's combat class gives you an idea of both their fighting style and occupational background.
			Realtistically, these two are rarely separate. Unless you're an aristocrat, you don't have the time and
			money to aquire skills of little use within your day-to-day life. So, a monk picks up his staff, or a
			veteran takes his sword from the mantlepiece, or else a scholar gathers her books. Each of them takes
			something familiar to them and does something extraordinary with it—and it all begins by embarking on an
			adventure!
		</p>
		<p>The easiest way to choose a class is to avoid all the details and just pick one that sounds cool. However, if
			you're of a mind to make an informed decision by carefully examine the unique features of each class, you
			certainly can! There are no wrong choices, only interesting ones.
		</p>
		<p>There is some ongoing debate as to the ideal number of classes in a TTRPG system. Too few classes, and
			players are less likely to find one that really captures their interest and vision. Too many, and the player
			is at risk of being drowned by excess choices—which may not be well balanced, either! I’ve decided to use 20
			classes, which are grouped into five categories, listed below. Players who struggle to pick a class can thus
			choose between one of these five categories and then choose between one of the four classes within that
			category. Hopefully it is easier to make two simple choices than one complicated choice.

<p>In addition to each category’s attribute and proficiency bonus, each class category has a special bonus ability
	shared between all characters in that category. Here’s what each ability does:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Heavy Attack</b>: When making a strength-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 AP to increase the damage of
		your attack. If it hits, you may roll your weapon's damage die a second time and add its value to the total
		damage for the attack.
	</li>
	<li><b>Mana Regeneration</b>: When starting a combat turn with less than two AP, gain one ability point.</li>
	<li><b>Precision Strike</b>: When making a dexterity-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 AP to gain +3 to hit on
		the attack roll and lower the critical threshold by 1. (i.e. from 20 to 19, typically.)
	</li>
	<li><b>Beast Speech</b>: You know the language of beasts, and may converse with them at any time. Once a day, you
		may expend 5 AP to attempt a persuasion check to convince an animal to fight by your side for 1 hour. The
		difficulty of the check depends on the type of animal being recruited.
	</li>
	<li><b>Meditation</b>: Once per long rest and while outside of combat, you may expend 5 AP to meditate or pray to
		your deity. You may increase an attribute of your choice by 2 for one hour, not exceeding the hard cap.
	</li>
</ul>
<p> In addition to these bonuses, the proficiency bonus of the base skill for each category advances to the next level
	at level 5 and again at level 10. This bonus cannot increase the proficiency bonus beyond mastery.
</p>
<p>A detailed explanation of classes is given below, in alphabetical order.</p>
<h5><a id="Choosing_a_Class_Assassin"></a>Assassin</h5>
<p>An assassin’s art is a quick and sure death, delivered without remorse or hesitation. Typically employed by a
	political state or criminal syndicate, assassins quickly learn to make use of any weapon available, including the
	weapons of their own targets. This makes them extremely versatile adventurers, able to adapt to nearly any combat
	situation as the need arises.
</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for an assassin, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Who has hired you in the past?</li>
	<li>How many targets have you killed?</li>
	<li>Do you remember your first kill?</li>
	<li>How did you acquire your unique skillset?</li>
	<li>Does your character struggle with any form of guilt?</li>
	<li>What made you give up your previous life and start adventuring?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Non-Good</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Assassination.</i>You may expend 2 willpower to convert an ordinary attack into an
	assassination attempt. If the attack results in a critical hit, it becomes an assassination, damaging an enemy by 15
	in addition to your normal weapon damage.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: assassination attempts can be combined with other moves, such as precision strike.
</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Additional Class Information:</button>
<div class="content">

			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Leveling Bonuses</b>:</p>
	<p>At level 1, you gain +2 dexterity and proficiency in accuracy.</p>
	<p>At level 2, learn <i>Hideaway.</i>Wherever you travel, you know the location of at least one secret hideout,
		lair, NPC, or dead drop location. Whenever the party takes a long rest, you may choose to visit this location
		instead of receiving the benefits of a long rest.
	</p>
	<p>While at your hideout, you may accept an assassination contract. The contract names an NPC and a bounty of at
		least 100 gold to be paid upon the contract’s completion. If the NPC perishes for any reason while you have the
		contract, you receive the specified sum the following morning. You do not have to visit the hideaway to receive
		payment. You may not have more than one assassination contract at a time, but you may cancel an active contract
		in order to receive a new one. You may not visit your hideaway if you are imprisoned, within a dungeon, or
		sufficiently deep in the wilderness.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: If the party spends multiple nights in or near a town, it is plausible that an
		Assassin character would be able to gain the benefits of a full rest on one night while visiting their secret
		location on another night.
	</p>
	<p>At level 3, you may choose to further specialize as either a Ninja or a Saboteur:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">As a Ninja, you gain advantage on stealth checks, and on attack rolls with thrown
		weapons.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">As a Saboteur, you gain a toolbelt of 3 grenades whenever you visit your hideaway.
		Each grenade deals 4d4 explosion damage to all targets within a ten foot radius. Targets up to twenty feet take
		half damage. You may not possess more than 3 grenades at a time.
	</p>
	<p>At level 4, learn one of these abilities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Assassination: Descending Blade</i>:</li>
		<li><i>Assassination: </i></li>
	</ul>
	<p><i>Assassination: Descending Blade</i>. You may trigger an assassination when leaping down onto your target from
		a height of ten or more feet, even if you were not already concealed.
	</p>
	<p>At level 6, Assassination minimum damage is increased by 10.</p>
	<p>At level 7, as a Ninja: learn <i>Assassination: Deadly Toxin</i>. You learn a codename that connects you to a
		supplier of deadly poison. When hideaway is activated, you may spend 100 gold to purchase a vial of deadly toxin
		from this supplier. You may purchase only one vial of this poison at a time. With a bonus action, you (or
		another party member, with an action) may coat their blade with the toxin, converting their next melee weapon
		strike into an assassination. If you forget the name of the supplier, you lose this ability. You may attempt to
		re-learn the codename by inquiring at the hideaway, at the discretion of them DM. If at any point you disclose
		the name of the supplier (whether intentional or not), the supplier dispatches 1d4 assassins to terminate you,
		who attack your party during a night’s rest.
	</p>
	<p>Note: If the hideaway location is a dead drop, you do not purchase the toxin immediately. Instead, you leave
		behind a special mark or indication, along with the payment. The poison will be in your pack by the time you
		return to camp.
	</p>
	<p>At level 7, as a Saboteur: learn <i>Nail Bomb</i>. You learn a codename that connects you to an arms
		manufacturer. When hideaway is activated, you may spend 500 gold to purchase a bomb that deals 6d6 + 12 piercing
		damage to all targets within 20 feet. The bomb is armed or disarmed by inserting a special key, and can be
		configured to explode on touch, after a delay, or by a proximity spell. If disassembly is attempted, the bomb
		explodes, even if it was not armed.
	</p>
	<p>At level 8, gain <i>Assassination: Vital Strike</i>. When vital strike triggers a critical, it now triggers an

<h5><a id="Choosing_a_Class_Barbarian"></a>Barbarian</h5>
<p>Whether a local farmhand or a tribesman from a remote tundra or jungle, barbarians are united by their unparalleled
	fury in battle, as well as sheer physical brawn. By tapping into primal rage, barbarians can strike harder and
	faster than anyone else while laughing off blows that would stagger an ordinary man. Barbarians typically wear light
	armor, and swing the largest weapons they can find. Their bodies are often covered in scars, either from tribal
	initiation rituals, or past battles. Some barbarians channel their rage in a drunken stupor, while others transform
	into the animals that embody their inner beast.
</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for an assassin, consider the following:
<ol>
	<li>Have you always been strong, or did you go through a lot of training?
	</li>
	<li>Is your immense brawn shared by other members of your family or tribe?
	</li>

<p>The knight is a low-ranking noble with formal combat training. Although they may be called to fight in battle, a
	knight’s primary purpose is to serve for the glory of their Lord or Lady, to whom they have sworn an oath of fealty.
	Many knights are also accompanied by a squire, a young knight in training who may carry their lord’s banner or help
	them don and doff their armor.
</p>
<p>On the battlefield, a knight is a magnificent sight, clad in expensive steel plate armor and with their lord’s
	ensignia emblazoned on their shield. However, some knights forgo a shield altogether, preferring a heavier
	two-handed weapon. Either way, knights train extensively and are rarely caught flat-footed, even when out of armor.
</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for a knight, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>How far back can you trace your lineage?</li>
	<li>Did you train as a page and a squire before becoming a knight?</li>

<h5><a id="Choosing_a_Class_Warlock"></a>Warlock</h5>
<p>Warlocks are a diverse sort, hailing from many walks of life. You may find one in a palace in the very heart of
	luxury, another in a dingy cave or a squalid coven, and a third in a quaint shack amidst a great forest. Wherever
	they are found, warlocks are defined by their immense power, gained from their pact with a supernatural entity. The
	terms of these pacts are as diverse and as varied as warlocks themselves, and bring danger, madness, and power in
	equal measure.
</p>
<p>A warlock is an entity who has entered into a pact with an immaterial being, offering service in return for a
	fraction of the supplicated entity’s power. Broadly speaking, such pacts are usually made with demonic or fey
	beings, for angels and dragons have little use of pacts.
</p>
<p>demonic patrons typically allow their supplicants to dispose of their power in whatever manner they wish, in exchange
	for enslavement in the afterlife. Conversely, fey entities constantly demand small favors or acts of service, but
	care very little for their supplicant’s eternal fate.

		A black cloaked figure brings you to the edge of a dark pool, and bids you to immerse yourself in the waters
		therein. Once fully submerged, an eldritch horror beyond human comprehension enters your head through your eyes
		and nasal passages, bringing you visions of deep and forbidden knowledge. The entity fills your skull with
		whispers of infinite knowledge, a taste of what shall be yours if you swear your life to its service.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 75px;">An eldritch tome with gilded pages. Opening the book transports your mind to an astral
		library of esoteric and arcane knowledge. Once per level, including this level, you may use this tome to acquire
		learned knowledge of any spell for which you meet the requirements. If anyone else attempts to use this tome,
		they must succeed a threshold 12 willpower check, or become mad for 1d4 days. The tome then crumbles to ash in
		their hands, and is returned to your possession the next time the clock strikes midnight.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">2. Dark Pact: Profane Champion</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">You slowly come to awareness, surrounded by a stinking and suffocating darkness. You
		hear the noise of buzzing flies, and see—or seem to see—the form of a wretched man, sewn inside a bodybag and
		swaying from the end of a noose. There is a sudden bolt of lightning and the bodybag splits open, exposing a
		gleaming silver blade among its visceral contents. As your hand grips the hilt, a sneering voice from within
		beseeches you to use the blade in service to True Death.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 75px;">A gleaming silver weapon which has an unnatural tendency to strike true. The weapon
		may take the form of a short weapon, medium weapon, or great weapon. The weapon’s hit chance increases with your
		charisma modifier. Each successful hit with this weapon during combat increases the damage of your next eldritch
		blast invocation by 1.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">3. Dark Pact: Infernal Tyrant</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">You are brought before the flaming throne of a demonic tyrant, with eyes of burning
		darkness. The entity does not speak to you, but a snap of his fingers directs a malnourished slave to present
		you with a flaming parchment scrawled in blood. The meaning of the worlds are burned into your mind: a slave for
		a slave. If you accept, you may choose one of the tyrant’s slaves to serve you in life. In return, you shall
		become the tyrant’s slave after your death—for eternity?
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 75px;">An infernal servant, bound to your will. You may banish the servant back to their
		master’s realm at will, and summon them again once per long rest. The servant fights and levels as you do, and
		may be any race or gender of your choosing. However, they take a -3 penalty to all attributes, soft and hard
		caps, and their health and willpower are reduced by one half. They may choose a class category, but not a class,
		and are leveled to your current level.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">4. Fey Pact: Crystal Pixie</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">You find yourself reduced to miniscule size, peering out of the hollow of a tree. At
		first,
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 75px;"><br/><br/></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><br/><br/></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">5. Fey Pact: Storm Djinn</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The entity takes you to a great palace in the clouds, everywhere bedecked with signs
		of unparalleled splendor: gates and trimmings of pure gold, gleaming pillars of marble, and tapestries of silk
		and satin. You are lead up a stair in a great minaret, past great windows at increasingly dizzying heights. At
		the top, a mighty Djinn
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><br/><br/></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;">6. Fey Pact: Celestial of the Great Comet</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Your you find yourself in the vast darkness of outer space. Stars swirl around you and
		dance across your body, sparkling with splendor.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 75px;"><br/><br/></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><br/><br/></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><br/><br/></p>
	<p>You may accept this pact and all boons it confers, or reject it. If rejected, another pact will be offered on a
		subsequent night. If the DM allows, you do not need to roll a d6 again and may simply choose the pact you
		desire.

<h5><a id="Choosing_a_Class_Wizard"></a>Wizard</h5>
<p>Cloistered in his high tower, a tall and heavily bearded man pushes arcane magic to its absolute limit. Bedecked in a
	great flowing robe and pointed hat, he ensures that the stars and planets align before pursuing his audacious
	experiment. Sanity and restraint long forsaken, he clutches a pristine crystal ball, gazing somewhere within as blue
	electricity arcs from the tips of his fingers.
</p>
<p>No-one knows how he got his power; some say it runs in his blood, while others say that he was expelled from a
	university. Whatever the case, a wizard is someone with a naturally high aptitude for magic who usually practices on
	their own terms, outside the auspices of a university.
</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for a wizard, consider the following:</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Favored Spell</i>. At level 1, choose a spell from your spell list as your favorite. When you
	cast this spell, you add your willpower ASM to the spell damage in addition to the regular spell damage modifier.
</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Leveling Bonuses:</button>
<div class="content">
	<p><b>Leveling Bonuses</b>:</p>
	<p>At level 1, choose and instantly learn three elemental spells. You know these spells innately, and can never
		forget them.
	</p>
	<p>At level 2,</p>
	<p>At level 3, you</p>

<h4><a id="Choosing_an_Alignment"></a>Choosing an Alignment</h4>
<p>In keeping with traditional TTPRGs, we use a simple alignment system to roughly track a character’s motives. The
	alignment chart has two axes: <i>lawfulness </i>and <i>morality</i>. Lawfulness describes a character’s
	predictability and their faith (or lack of faith) in ideals. Meanwhile, morality describes a character’s level of
	empathy and compassion for others, or lack thereof.
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Lawful Good</td>
		<td>Neutral Good</td>
		<td>Chaotic Good</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lawful Neutral</td>
		<td>True Neutral</td>
		<td>Chaotic Neutral</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lawful Evil</td>
		<td>Neutral Evil</td>
		<td>Chaotic Evil</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>A character’s alignment provides a rough guide to how they intend to behave. Of course, a character’s alignment can
	change over time, and not all actions are perfectly representative of their alignment. Also, certain actions don’t
	have a middle ground. You either run into a burning orphanage to save the children, or you don’t. Such circumstances
	can be polarizing, driving character development and pushing neutral characters towards the extremes of morality.
	Likewise, polarizing events might also serve to disillusion good characters and turn them evil or neutral, or
	inspire evil characters to reconsider their ways.
</p>
<p>Before we move on, I’d like to dispel some misconceptions regarding lawfulness and the alignment chart in general.
	First, alignment should always be secondary to a character’s personality. Second, lawfulness is often used to
	capture two separate ideas. The first interpretation is <i>a tendency to follow laws </i>while the second is <i>a
		tendency to believe in and adhere to some fixed set of ideals</i>. This leads to confusion because a seemingly
	lawful paladin could suddenly start breaking laws if they travel to a land where the foreign laws conflict heavily
	with their ideals. It’s not always clear whether this represents a change in alignment or not. Although there’s no
	single correct interpretation, I suggest a third interpretation that lawful characters tend to behave according to
	reason and logic, while chaotic characters behave according to emotion. One advantage of this interpretation is that
	it allows lawful characters the flexibility to sometimes be driven by pure emotion, and also explains when and why
	chaotic characters behave unpredictably—as opposed to just providing chaos for the sake of chaos.
</p>
<h4><a id="Writing_a_Backstory"></a>Writing a Backstory</h4>
<p>In a medieval or renaissance setting, very few characters are either physically or financially disposed to go
	cavorting about on grand adventures slaying dragons and dispatching necromancers and whatnot. Most of the characters
	in this sort of world are farmers, either working on a manor for their feudal lord or fending for themselves on the
	edges of civilization. Whether they're tied down by social expectations, afraid of death and the unkown, or just too
	damn comfortable, the simple fact is that <i>most people are not, and never will be, adventurers</i>.
</p>
<p>So who does go adventuring? If not the cowardly and mediocre, then only the strongest, boldest, and most daring
	individuals remain. <i>That's you!</i> Whether young or old, rich or poor, man or woman, an adventurer is someone
	who possesses <i>true courage</i>, and a compelling <i>vision</i>. Whatever your old life was, you're leaving it
	behind to try something new and exciting. Dangerous, certainly, but also glorious.
</p>
<p>Your backstory can be as long or short as you want it to be. Write from your heart, and create a character that
	resonates with you. As you write your backstory, try to think about what drove them to abandon their old life and
	become an adventurer. Here are some general questions to get you started:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Is your character the sort to make elaborate plans, or do they react to the world around them on the fly?</li>
	<li>Has anyone in their family ever been an adventurer? Are they inspired by legends of adventurers past?</li>
	<li>Does the idea of protecting the innocent and vulnerable resonate with your character?</li>
	<li>Was your character displaced by a natural disaster, such as a fire or flood?</li>
	<li>Has your character known financial extremes, such as wealth or poverty?</li>
	<li>What do they hope to find as an adventurer? Some adventurers seek fame, money, friendship, or true love, while
		others seek revenge or even adventure itself.
	</li>
	<li>Is your character leaving anything behind in their decision to go adventuring? Perhaps family, an ancestral home
		or village, or a spouse?
	</li>
	<li>How does your character come across to others? Are they amiable, eccentric, softspoken, confident, or perhaps
		dark and brooding?
	</li>
	<li>How does your character feel about the downsides of adventuring, such as death, injury, or poverty?</li>
	<li>Are there any unresolved threads from their old life that could come back to haunt them, such as a sworn enemy,
		estranged family, or the law?
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting equipment depends on your character's class. If you choose, you can supplement your character's gear by
	visiting a merchant before your adventure starts.
