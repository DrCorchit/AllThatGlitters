<p>Many forms of armor are available for the prospective adventurer. In general, nimble and dexterous characters such as
	thieves and assassins prefer leather armor or brigandine. Barbarians, mercenaries, inquisitors, and most others
	usually make use of medium armors, such as breastplate or chainmail. Knights, veterans, and crusaders often wear
	splinted mail or even full plate, being stouter folk.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Cheaper forms of chainmail struggle versus piercing damage, but high quality mail no
	longer has this weakness. However, those talented with the estoc sword may yet be able to pierce it.</p>

<h5>Materials</h5>
<p>The stats given above are for steel armor. Some armors can be upgraded to rely on tougher metals such as titanium,
	orichalcum, adamantine, and mithril. These give better results but are significantly more expensive.</p>
