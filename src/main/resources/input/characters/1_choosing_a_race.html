<h4><a id="Choosing_a_Race"></a>Races</h4>
<p>There are eight example races here, representing some favorite repeat offenders from the fantasy genre. That said,
	homebrewing new races is very much in the spirit of All that Glitters, and if a race you want to play isn’t in this
	list, you absolutely should create it. Alternatively, feel free to create your own lore for any of these races—don’t
	let my ideas stifle yours! Further on, I’ll explain some guidelines for creating new races while also respecting
	gameplay balance.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Human"></a>
<h5>Human</h5>
<p>Overall, humans are proud, robust, and athletic. I daresay we are altogether quite handsome. Men average around 5’9”
	in height; women around 5’4”. Weight varies greatly, usually between 100-200 lbs. We live between 70 and 90 years,
	if we do not die in one of our many wars.
</p>
<p>Although we humans may seem an uninspiring choice to some, it’s all a matter of perspective. To dwarves, we are tall
	and regal. To elves, we are robust and warlike. Among saurids, we are called slow and loud. And so it goes.
</p>
<p>Human characters start with a single bonus point in an ability of their choice, and may take a level of proficiency
	in any skill. Humans are well suited to any class.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Elf"></a>
<h5>Elf</h5>
<p>Graceful and elegant, elves exemplify much of what humans aspire to be. In height, male elves average about 6’3”;
	female elves about 5’9”. Weight varies between 120-200 lbs. They are barely heavier than humans, despite their
	increased stature. The gods have truly blessed their race: they live around 200 years at least, and some (of the
	royal line) as long as five hundred.
</p>
<p>Over time, their kind has diverged into three bloodlines. Descendants of the royal bloodline are called Eldarii and
	excel in magic and all manner of letters. They incorporate magic into nearly every level of society. As a
	consequence, even their young children know basic spells. They are invariably blonde haired and fair skinned, and
	persistently arrogant. Some of them attempt to repent their hubris, but I have come to prefer the frank honesty of
	arrogance to a feigned humility.
</p>
<p>Members of the common line are called Numenarii, and pursue archery, hunting, fishing, and farming. They have
	interbred on occasion with humans, and so take on darker hair and skin tones. They imitate the arrogance of the
	Eldarii, though it is but a veneer: they are quite insecure.
</p>
<p>Members of the third bloodline are called Drow, and are descended from the line of the nameless usurper. Tales of
	their cruelty are exaggerated, but not by much. Their skin is bluish gray, and their hair silver. They do not spare
	themselves from their own ruthless designs, and many attempt to escape their subterranean holds. Those few who do
	often become brave adventurers.
</p>
<p>All elven characters suffer a -1 penalty to strength, and gain bonuses depending on their bloodline. Those of the
	royal line gain +2 INT and knowledge of a level 1 spell, plus proficiency in literacy, along with deficiency in
	survival. Members of the common line gain +2 DEX and proficiency in nature and accuracy. Drow gain +2 WILL and
	proficiency in perception and stealth. Drow also have the gift of darkvision.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Dwarf"></a>
<h5>Dwarf</h5>
<p>A short and ruddy race. Male dwarves average around 5 feet in height, while their females average around 4’8”.
	Despite their stature, they weigh between 100-160 lbs. It is customary for their men to grow long beards, though
	beards longer than twenty inches are seldom seen outside storybooks. They live a bit longer than humans, so a
	century and a half is not out of the question.
</p>
<p>The dwarves of yore possessed insatiable bloodthirst and fought man, elf, and dragon alike in a great many wars.
	Times have changed, and they have been at peace nigh on two millennia. They are now greatly concerned with the
	exploration of mountains and caves, the industry of mining, and the acquisition of gold.
</p>
<p>Despite their unusual habits and short stature, dwarves are actually a fairly well balanced race that can excel in
	many roles. Dwarves gain +1 STR and +1 WILL at the cost of -2 SPD, and choose an additional +1 in STR or WILL. Also,
	dwarves have a keen sense for gold and have advantage on perception and persuasion checks when searching for
	treasure or bartering with merchants. All dwarves have proficiency in defense. Dwarves make particularly fearsome
	warriors, but are a solid choice in many other roles.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Halfling"></a>
<h5>Halfling</h5>
<p>The shortest of the races, halfling men average 3’9” in height. Their women are yet shorter, scantly 3’6” by average.
	A tall halfling may resemble a short dwarf, though the former will be discernible by his slender build and wispy
	facial hair, if he has any at all. Halflings weigh only 50-100 lbs, and I’ll wager a drink you can’t find a heavier
	one in under a fortnight. They are somewhat long lived, often lasting a bit more than a century.
</p>
<p>As timeless as their quaint and cozy country villages may seem, they are no strangers to change. Nearly half of them
	are now second or third generation immigrants in large cities. They are unwelcome there on account of their ill
	reputation: it is said that nearly a third of them are criminals. As thieves, they are exceedingly sly.
</p>
<p>Halflings tend to be unbalanced characters, having a -2 penalty to STR and a -2 penalty to SPD. They make up for this
	with a +2 to DEX, and another +2 to INT, CHA, or WILL. Urban halflings start with proficiency in parkour and sleight
	of hand, while rural halflings start with proficiency in nature and survival. They excel as mages, zealots, and
	renegades, but struggle as warriors.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Orc"></a>
<h5>Orc</h5>
<p>Stout and rippling with muscle, orcs are warriors to the last. Their menfolk are nearly as tall as the elves, around
	6’, and their women are barely any shorter, around 5’10”. Fully grown, they weigh somewhere between 180 to 300
	lbs—quite formidable! Their hair is almost invariably black or gray, while their skin ranges from dark green to pale
	yellow or gray. In years, they may reach 60 if they are lucky; usually less. They make up for this by living with
	what I will graciously call ‘extreme vigor’.
</p>
<p>The history of orcs is full of long and bloody intertribal conflicts. Despite this, they have made steady progress as
	a species and have transitioned from cave dwellings to small villages, then larger villages, until now many think to
	mingle with humans, dwarves, and halflings on the frontiers of civilization. (Elves will have none of their ilk.)
	They are well-suited to mercenary or guard work. They make poor thieves or wizards.
</p>
<p>Orcs gain +2 to STR and WILL, at the cost of -1 to DEX and -1 INT, and an addional -1 to either INT or CHA. They have
	proficiency in intimidation and survival.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Tiefling"></a>
<h5>Tiefling</h5>
<p>Of middling stature and musculature, tieflings are nearly human. Yet as the saying goes, ‘so close and yet so far.’
	By virtue of their debauched bloodline (the devil-dealings of their ancestors being no small secret) they are cursed
	with horns, pointed ears, and skin of a blood-red hue (or other outrageous colors). Almost everywhere, they are
	shunned by all ‘good’ folk. Yet I think they can be accorded a little understanding, for they are neither warlike
	nor pompous, and wisely take their poor lot in life with a dose of good humor.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to give a straightforward account of their physical nature, because it is so widely varied. I have
	seen some as short as 5’ and others as tall as 6’8”. Their are neither particularly bulky nor slender, and so their
	weight is comparable to that of a human. Only in longevity have the gods relented, granting them perhaps 110 years,
	around the same span as a halfling.
</p>
<p>Tieflings typically live in colonies suitably removed from human and elven settlements. They have dealings with
	dwarves and halflings, who treat them fairly. They quietly pursue industry and keep to themselves, but their young
	oft grow weary of their meek ways and seek adventure and companionship abroad.
</p>
<p>Tieflings gain +1 to CHA and DEX, and an additional +1 to INT or CHA, at the cost of -2 WILL. They possess the gift
	of darkvision, and can see in total darkness to a range of 3 yards, or dim light to about 30 yards. They have
	proficiency in performance and either medicine or perception.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Aarakocra"></a>
<h5>Aarakocra</h5>
<p>Flighty and covered with feathers, the Aarakocra are an extremely vibrant and colorful race. There are as many
	sub-races of these as of man or elf; it seems that many take after some species of bird or another. So you have one
	with feathers of azure and gold, another crimson, cream, and jade, and a third black as a raven. In general, they
	are about the size of a man, but extraordinarily light. I think 5'6" is a typical height, but they weigh less than
	80 pounds. Their longevity varies greatly, and some have a span of up to 250 years, rivaling even the elves.
	However, this is not common and I have met very few over the age of ninety or so.
</p>
<p>On my travels, I have observed that Aarakocra races and tribes can be roughly divided into two categories: raptors
	and songbirds. The former are taller and stronger, and possess extremely keen hearing and sight. As for the
	songbirds, they are extremely quick with their limbs and can mimic almost any sound they hear. They have a
	reputation for bing tricksters, and are in the habit of gathering shiny things, as their brothers the ravens and
	crows do.
</p>
<p>Aarakocra gain a +2 bonus to SPD, but -2 to STR. All aarakocra can glide and are immune to fall damage. Raptors gain
	+1 STR and proficiency in perception, while songbirds gain +1 DEX and proficiency in performance.
</p><a id="Choosing_a_Race_Saurid"></a>
<h5>Saurid</h5>
<p>Slinking, skulking, scurrying—these are words befitting a saurid. Treading the slender line between man and beast,
	they are a fierce folk. As much lizard as man, they possess scaly hides, long tails, and snouts lined with razor
	sharp teeth. Some say they are cruel, but having observed them closely on more than one occasion, I would rather
	describe them as practical.
</p>
<p>A saurid is typically shorter than a man, but they grow all their lives until old age. Some can become quite large.
	Their females are a bit taller and more muscular than their males. In terms of height, they reach about 5’6” while
	the male might reach only 5’2 or so. They are not long-lived, and seventy years is a ripe age for a saurid.
</p>
<p>The saurids I have seen are fairly xenophobic, and live in colonies inside caves usually near water. They hunt, fish,
	and raise their hatchlings quietly, having few dealings with man or elf, except for the occasional territorial
	clash. They have developed a unique sort of architecture, and their colonies are quite remarkable, often lavishly
	decorated with precious stones and cut stone. Their predilection for gathering all things shiny has attracted
	dwarven traders, which has brought the common tongue to their knowledge. Many of them now seek adventure abroad,
	bringing with them their fearsome and curious ways.
</p>
<p>Saurids gain +2 to STR and SPD, at the cost of -2 INT and -1 CHA. They possess the gift of darkvision, able to see in
	near total darkness. They have deficiency in literacy, but may take proficiency in two out of initiative, stealth,
	or perception.
</p>
<h5>Custom Races</h5>
<p>When creating new races, consider following these general guidelines:</p>
<ol>
	<li>No stat bonus should exceed +2, and no stat penalty should exceed -2.</li>
	<li>The sum of all attribute bonuses minus all penalties should equal 1.</li>
	<li>Every race should have at least one proficiency bonus, but no more than 2.</li>
	<li>Ideally, the player should have some choices regarding either subraces, attributes, or proficiencies.</li>
	<li>Be careful making races that give +2 bonuses to both strength and dexterity, or both intelligence and will. Such
		races make very strong warriors or wizards respectively with very little downside.
	</li>
</ol>
<h5><a id="Size"></a>Size</h5>
<p>A character's race also determines their size. Size is not recorded on the character sheet, but is usually medium. If
	you picked a halfling, it's small. Size primarily affects what weapons a character can and can’t use, terminal
	velocity, and how effectively they can grapple. Grappling will be explained in further detail in <a
			href="c5.html#Grappling">chapter 5</a>, while fall damage and terminal velocity will be explained in <a
			href="c6.html#Falling">chapter 6</a>.
