<h4><a id="Choosing_an_Alignment"></a>Choosing an Alignment</h4>
<p>In keeping with traditional TTPRGs, we use a simple alignment system to roughly track a character’s motives. The
	alignment chart has two axes: <i>lawfulness </i>and <i>morality</i>. Lawfulness describes a character’s
	predictability and their faith (or lack of faith) in ideals. Meanwhile, morality describes a character’s level of
	empathy and compassion for others, or lack thereof.

<p>A character’s alignment provides a rough guide to how they intend to behave. Of course, a character’s alignment can
	change over time, and not all actions are perfectly representative of their alignment. Also, certain actions don’t
	have a middle ground. You either run into a burning orphanage to save the children, or you don’t. Such circumstances
	can be polarizing, driving character development and pushing neutral characters towards the extremes of morality.
	Likewise, polarizing events might also serve to disillusion good characters and turn them evil or neutral, or
	inspire evil characters to reconsider their ways.

<p>Before we move on, I’d like to dispel some misconceptions regarding lawfulness and the alignment chart in general.
	First, alignment should always be secondary to a character’s personality. Second, lawfulness is often used to
	capture two separate ideas. The first interpretation is <i>a tendency to follow laws </i>while the second is <i>a
		tendency to believe in and adhere to some fixed set of ideals</i>. This leads to confusion because a seemingly
	lawful paladin could suddenly start breaking laws if they travel to a land where the foreign laws conflict heavily
	with their ideals. It’s not always clear whether this represents a change in alignment or not. Although there’s no
	single correct interpretation, I suggest a third interpretation that lawful characters tend to behave according to
	reason and logic, while chaotic characters behave according to emotion. One advantage of this interpretation is that
	it allows lawful characters the flexibility to sometimes be driven by pure emotion, and also explains when and why
	chaotic characters behave unpredictably—as opposed to just providing chaos for the sake of chaos.
