  "description": "The prophet is an individual called upon by a specific god to bring about religious transformation. Often a firebrand or a heretic, prophets care little for the practical consequences of their actions and instead operate based off of faith and unwavering moral or spiritual convictions. For this reason, they are scorned and hated by religious authorities and may be on the run.",
