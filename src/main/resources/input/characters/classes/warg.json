  "name": "Warg",
  "description": "A warg is usually a hermit or cultist who—over many years—has cultivated the ability to transform at will into a certain animal. Unlike a druid, who can transform into a number of small animals, a warg can only transform into one type of animal. But what a warg sacrifices in flexibilty, they gain in power. Wargs usually transform into large animals, such as a direwolf, rune bear, or even the mighty rhinoceros.",
