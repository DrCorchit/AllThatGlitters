  "description": "The powers of a true psychic are a sight to behold. Imagine, for example, an unassuming young woman clad in simple black robes. She raises her hand and her eyes glow bright white, and suddenly the earth begins to tremble. A rock surges upward from the soil, bidden by her telekinetic impulse, and is sent flying towards its target. Surely such power is to be covetedâ€”and feared!",

  "coreAbilityDescription": "As a psychic prodigy, you begin the game with the knowledge of the spells \"Telekinetic Lift\", \"Lesser Telekinetic Pull\", and \"Telekinetic Throw\". You know these spells by rote and may cast them even if you do not meet the attribute requirements. Psionic spells cost half as many training slots when learned.",
