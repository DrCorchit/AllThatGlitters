  "description": "The path to enlightenment is not without its twists and turns. For some, a monastery is a permanent homeâ€”a place to perfect the techniques of breathing, martial arts, and meditation. For others, the monastery is only a resting place before embarking on the road to adventure. Adventuring monks journey far and wide, where they become known for seemingly superhuman feats of endurance, speed, and strength enabled by extensive training.",
