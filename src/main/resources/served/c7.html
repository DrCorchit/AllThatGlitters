<h2>Chapter 7</h2><h3>How does my character use magic?</h3>
<blockquote>Any sensible treatise on magic will disclose the following insight: <i>magic is energy</i>. Therefore, magic
	is classified according to whence this energy originates, the techniques used to manipulate it, and finally
	according to the overall purpose of its application. In fact, all spells follow the same basic pattern, whereby the
	magus identifies a source of energy, attains control, and finally disposes the energy according to his whim.
	<p style="text-align: right;">— Albrecht Riftenvorg, <i>A Primer on Magic</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In gameplay terms, players practice magic by learning spells and then casting them.</p>
<h4>Learning Spells</h4>
<p>In order to learn a spell, the player must either find spellbook or a trainer who has knowledge of that specific
	spell. Scholars partially circumvent this requirement by having access to a magical academy full of arcane tomes and
	professors. However, respectable institutions do not carry knowledge of unethical forms of magic such as necromancy
	or demonolatry (at least, not if they want to retain their reputation). Therefore, some forms of magic are
	inherently esoteric and difficult to learn, let alone master.</p>
<p>Once an appropriate trainer or tome has been located, the player must meet certain requirements, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A certain level of an attribute</li>
	<li>Proficiency in certain skills</li>
	<li>Prerequisite spells</li>
	<li>A certain number of training slots</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all these requirements are met, the player may learn the spell from the tome or trainer. Once learned, the spell
	can only be unlearned if the player intentionally forgets it, usually in order to free up training slots.</p>
<h4>Casting Spells</h4>
<p>Once a spell has been learned, certain additional requirements must be met in order to cast the spell. These
	requirements depend on the type of spell, which falls into one of four categories: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Burst Spells</b>: Spells which are cast and take effect instantaneously or almost instantaneously.</li>
	<li><b>Concentration Spells</b>: Spells which are cast over a span of time. Usually require a burst of AP to
		initiate the spell and a smaller amount to maintain it.
	</li>
	<li><b>Rituals</b>: Spells that require careful and methodic preparation. These spells are not normally cast during
		combat.
	</li>
	<li><b>Ceremonies</b>: Spells that require a certain number of participants. Such spells usually consume some AP
		from each participant, each contributing some AP towards the casting of the spell. These spells are not normally
		cast during of combat.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>All spells require a certain amount of AP to be cast. In addition to this, some spells can be cast</p>


<p>Despite being intensely studied, magic remains an abstruse and opaque subject. Among those who study it, there is no
	consensus as to why certain individuals wield its power so effortlessly, why certain spells are so difficult to
	reproduce, and why other spells work at all. This inconvenience doesn't stop scholars from doing the one thing they
	are truly good at, however: categorizing things.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, the three types of spells are <i>divination</i>, <i>conjuration</i>, and <i>evocation</i>.
	Divination magic is concerned with information, whether collecting, transmitting, or fabricating it. Conjuration
	deals with spirits, whether they are summoned, bound, or banished. Finally, evocation deals with the disposition of
	energy, applying it for creation, preservation, transformation, or destruction. Each of these types are further
	subdivided and studied under various magical schools. In theory, schools ending in -mancy indicate divination while
	those ending in -urgy indicate evocation. In practice, commonfolk tend not to appreciate this distinction and make
	quite a mess of things. For example, there was once a distinction between necromancy and necromurgy; the former was
	concerned with contacting deceased spirits, while the latter was concerned with raising their bodies. However, the
	latter term has become practically obsolete, leaving the term "necromancy" to describe any form of death-related
	magic, divination or otherwise. </p>
<p>To further muddy the waters, modern magic often employs "hybrid" spells incorporating aspects of various schools of
	magic. For example, the spell <i>Nystaff's magical orchestra</i> summons an entire troop of fey musicians who </p>
<p>Scholars categorize magic primarily according to its source. Part of the reason they do so is certain sources of
	magic are considered inherently unethical. In general, two types of magic are considered unethical:
	<i>demonolatry</i> (conjuration of demons), and <i>necromancy</i> (harvesting of souls, and raising of the dead).
	All else is fair game.</p>
<p>Here are the most common sources of magic:</p>
<h4>Human Magic</h4>
<p>The most common type of magic involves channeling one's own life essence as a source of power for spells. Often
	called <i>anthurgy</i> or <i>auturgy</i>, this form of magic does not draw</p>
<h4></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Viviurgy, the working of the lifeforce<p>
		Viviurgy is the most basic form of magic. Even when not used directly, it is often used to initiate spells from
		other schools. The most common variation of viviurgy involves a mage channeling his or her own life force in a
		practice called egomancy. This form of magic is extremely versatile because the entire process is
		self-contained. The downside of this practice is that its power is limited and overuse leads to exhaustion (and
		in rare cases, death) of the practitioner. Another downside is that it is difficult to use for divination, since
		it reaches inward rather than outward.</p>
		<p>In addition to auturgy, viviurgy also encompasses pair magic and ceremonial magic. In pair magic, one mage
			essentially becomes a living battery, acting as a source for the other's magic. In ceremonial magic, an
			assembly of participants works their magic in concert, harmonizing their power towards a shared goal. </p>
	</li>
	<li>Conjuration, the summoning or consultation of spirits <p>
		Conjuration magic is categorized according to the type of spirit summoned, and the method used to summon. The
		upside of this form of magic is that the summoned spirits tend to wield greater power than a human can on their
		own. Most spirits rather enjoy being summoned, as the physical world is seen as fairly exciting and chaotic.
		Therefore, they usually make a reasonable attempt to fulfill the summoner's bidding, in hopes of being summoned
		again. However, having their own free will, spirits (especially fey) can behave unpredictably. In general, a
		supplication spell summons a spirit willingly, while a binding spell summons and restrains a spirit unwillingly.
		The latter practice is widely considered unethical.</p>
		<p>
			A proper discussion of conjuration requires knowledge of the four types of greater spirits: angels, demons,
			fey, and dragons, corresponding to the elements of air, earth, water, and fire, and the compass directions
			of north, south, east, and west, respectively. Thus, the art of conjuration is categorized into
			draconolatry, demonolatry, fey worship, and supplication.</p></li>
	<li>Necromancy, the magic of the dead. <p>
		All spells from this school of magic are strictly forbidden in nearly every corner of the world. In general,
		there are two forms of necromancy: leaching and raising. Leaching draws energy from the spirits of the dead,
		while raising forces energy back in.</p></li>
	<li>Astrology, the magic of the spheres</li>
	<li>Geomancy, the magic of nature <p>Animals vs Plants</p></li>
	<li>Pragomancy, the magic of physical objects <p>
		Pragomancy is capacitation, transduction, obliteration </p></li>
