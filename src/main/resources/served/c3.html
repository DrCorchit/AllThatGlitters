<h2>Chapter 3</h2><h3><a id="C3"></a>What's on my character sheet?</h3>
<p>In All That Glitters, characters have several important aspects that determine what they can do in and out of
	combat:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Attributes">Attributes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Skills">Skills</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Proficiency_Levels">Proficiency Levels</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Race_Class_and_Size">Race, Class, and Size</a></li>

	<li><a href="#Mitigation">Mitigation</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Equipment">Equipment and Inventory</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Attributes"></a>Attributes</h4>
<p>The capabilities of player characters are determined by six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Speed, Intelligence,
	Charisma, and Willpower. Attributes describe the raw physical and mental capabilities of a player. For a given
	character, each attribute has a value, typically from 0 to 20. In general, a score of 0 indicates a total absence of
	the attribute (as with someone who is dead or unconscious) while a score of 20 indicates a nearly superhuman level
	of aptitude. For humans, a score of ten indicates an average level of proficiency.</p>
<p>Each attribute has an associated hard cap and soft cap. A player can surpass the soft cap only through strenuous
	training, necessarily neglecting other attributes to do so. The hard cap cannot be surpassed through any amount of
	training, however. For humans, the soft cap for each ability is at 16, and the hard cap is at 20. Racial bonuses to
	any attribute increase both the soft and hard cap by the same amount. For example, since dwarves receive a +2 bonus
	to strength, they can later increase their strength to 22, surpassing the human limit of 20, because their racial
	bonus has increased both their hard and soft caps for that attribute. The effect also works in reverse: dwarves take
	a penalty to speed, and so cannot train their speed stat beyond 19.</p>

</table>
<p><br/>In addition to these effects, each attribute supports one or more skills, which are used during event rolls.
	Importantly, each attribute affects multiple aspects of gameplay, meaning that players should care about which stats
	they prioritize and which they neglect. Not every character needs to be well-rounded, but characters with unusual
	ability score distributions should feel somewhat unbalanced to play.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: In most situations, we do not use the attribute score directly, but the attribute
	score modifier (ASM). The ASM for an attribute is obtained by subtracting 10 from the attribute score. An average
	human with 10 for all attribute scores would thus have 0 for their attribute score modifiers.</p>
<h4><a id="Skills"></a>Skills</h4>
<p>Skills are related to attributes in that they are also used for event rolls. Every skill has an underlying supporting
	attribute, whose ASM is added to the roll as with an attribute check. In addition to this, players add a bonus from
	training called a proficiency bonus. The number rolled on the d20 plus the ASM plus the proficency bonus determine
	the final value for the event roll.</p>
<p>Although every skill depends on at least one attribute, several skills have a secondary supporting attribute whose
	modifier may be used instead, under certain circumstances. For example, a player who is sneaking may decide that
	they are too clumsy to move quietly and instead opt to sprint past the guard while his gaze is turned. In this case,
	the player is trying to use their ASM for speed instead of dexterity for the stealth check. Whether this type of
	substitution is used is situational. In fact, certain circumstances <i>require</i>that the alternative attribute
	score modifier is used, while others permit it, in which case it would only be used if the second attribute’s score
	is higher for that character.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all skills:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Skill Name</th>
		<th>Supporting Attributes</th>
		<th>Explanation</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

			skill affect attack rolls with ranged weapons.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Defense</td>
		<td>Str</td>
		<td>Used when shielding attacks outside of combat or attempting to quickly don and doff heavy armor. Proficiency
			bonuses for this skill affect what types of armor and shields can be used in combat.
		</td>
	</tr>

</table>
<h4><a id="Proficiency_Levels"></a>Proficiency Levels</h4>
<p>There are five levels of proficiency in each skill, as follows:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Deficiency</td>
		<td>-2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Proficiency</td>
		<td>2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Expertise</td>
		<td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mastery</td>
		<td>6</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Each of these labels indicate that the player has either undertaken training or has an especial weakness in that
	skill. Deficiencies can be overcome and expertise and mastery can be attained through training even after a
	character is made.</p>
<p>When players obtain proficiency bonuses to the same skill from multiple sources, they do not combine to advance one’s
	proficiency in that skill to the next level. The only exception to this rule is that proficiency bonuses from a
	player’s race and class can be combined, allowing a player to begin the game with expert level in that skill.</p>
<h4><a id="Race_Class_and_Size"></a>Race, Class, and Size</h4>
<p>Every character belongs to a race, which provides certain starting bonuses and determines the limits of their
	attribute scores. Race cannot be changed after a character is created. Examples of races include humans, elves, and
	dwarves.</p>
<p>A character’s race also determines their size class, ranging from tiny to huge. Size primarily affects what weapons a
	character can and can’t use, and how effectively they can grapple. Grappling will be explained in further detail in
	the combat section.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Size</th>
		<th>Maximum Height</th>
		<th>Grid Size</th>
		<th>Restrictions</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tiny</td>
		<td>2 feet</td>
		<td>0x0</td>
		<td>May not wield ordinary weapons (except daggers).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Small</td>
		<td>4 feet</td>
		<td>1x1</td>
		<td>May not wield versatile or great weapons.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Medium</td>
		<td>8 feet</td>
		<td>1x1</td>
		<td><br/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Large</td>
		<td>16 feet</td>
		<td>2x2</td>
		<td><br/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Huge</td>
		<td>32 feet</td>
		<td>3x3</td>
		<td>May not wield ordinary weapons (except great weapons).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Enormous</td>
		<td>No Maximum</td>
		<td>4x4</td>
		<td>May not wield ordinary weapons.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In addition to a race, each character has a class, which determines how they fight. Character’s classes confer some
	bonuses immediately, but most bonuses are unlocked as the player levels up. Unlike race, classes can be changed
	after a character is created, under certain circumstances.</p>
<h4><a id="Hitpoints"></a>Hit Points</h4>
<p>Hit points (HP) are a resource that cause the player to fall unconscious when depleted. Since the character cannot
	move or fight when unconscious, keeping HP from falling to zero is extremely important. There are two sets of rules
	that govern what happens when a player falls unconscious: permadeath and modern.</p>
<p>Under permadeath rules, once the player has been downed, they roll a d20 every time it is their turn in combat. Every
	roll of a 10 or higher is considered a save, while every roll of 9 or lower is considered a fail. If the character
	makes three saves, they become stable and do not need to make additional saves to stay alive. However, if a
	character accumulates three fails, they are dead and can only be revived by powerful resurrection magic. Under this
	system, players can be revived and resume fighting after being healed by any healing spell, regardless of how many
	saves they have failed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Under permadeath rules, rolling a natural 20 immediately causes the player to become
	stable.</p>
<p>The modern rules offer an alternative system where unconscious players do not need to make saving throws to stay
	alive. However, they also do not regain consciousness after being healed by healing magic. Instead, they regain
	consciousness 1d4 hours after combat is over.</p>
<p>In gameplay strategy, modern rules prioritize keeping the characters conscious, making single-target healing spells
	quite valuable. Permadeath rules favor mass healing spells that resurrect the character whenever they fall. You
	should think carefully about which system works best for you.</p>
<p>A character’s HP cannot exceed their maximum HP stat. Initially, maximum HP is equal to the strength attribute, but
	it increases over time as a character levels up. The precise amount will be explained in more detail in the section
	on character leveling. All missing HP is restored after a long rest, while only one-half is restored after a short
	rest.</p>
<h4><a id="Abilities_and_Ability_Points"></a>Abilities and Ability Points</h4>
<p>Ability points (AP) are similar to HP in that both are depleted during combat, recovered by resting, and have a
	maximum amount that increases as players level. AP are expended as the player uses powerful spells and abilities.
	When AP is fully depleted, the character is said to be exhausted. There is not an immediate penalty for this
	condition, other than not being able to use critically necessary abilities.</p>
<p>Like HP, all missing AP are restored after a long rest. Unlike HP, only one-third of missing attribute points are
	restored after a short rest. Maximum AP is affected by the willpower stat similarly to the way maximum HP is
	affected by the strength stat.</p>
<p>Abilities are learned or innate skills that confer some benefit to the player, such as spells, combat maneuvers, or
	proficiency improvements. Abilities are categorized in a few ways. First, abilities acquired from a player’s class
	(such as the barbarian’s rage) are called innate abilities. Abilities learned from trainers are called trained
	abilities, and finally trained abilities which have been fully mastered are called rote abilities. </p>
<p>Abilities are also classified by whether or not they are explicitly invoked by the player or if they take effect
	automatically. The former are called active abilities and usually cost AP to activate, while the latter are called
	passive abilities (or perks) and take effect without the use of AP.</p>
<p>An example of a passive ability would be a perk that restores HP at the start of the player’s turn. Since the player
	is not required to do anything to receive this benefit, it is passive. On the other hand, an ability that allows the
	player to spend AP to deal extra damage would be an active ability.</p>
<h4><a id="Mitigation"></a>Mitigation</h4>
<p>Mitigation is a derived statistic which determines how likely a player is to successfully dodge or block an attack,
	similar to armor class from DnD. During combat, melee and ranged attacks are treated as an event roll testing the
	martial arts or accuracy skill, respectively. In this situation, mitigation provides the difficulty threshold for
	whether the attack succeeds. Thus, players with high mitigation are hit less often and therefore survive longer.</p>
<p>Mitigation is composed primarily of two values: dodge chance (DC), conferred by the player’s dexterity attribute, and
	block chance (BC), conferred by the player’s shields, armor and defense skill profiency. A third value, parry
	chance, is less common but used when a player is actively attempting to parry an attack. The three values are added
	together to calculate total mitigation, but certain attacks may bypass some or all of the three values, reducing
	effective mitigation against that tactic. For example, most types of armor are not ideal for absorbing blows from
	blunt weapons. Accordingly, bludgeoning damage automatically bypasses half of the target’s BC.</p>
<p>The player’s DC is normally equal to their dexterity attribute, while BC and parry chance start at zero. Block chance
	is increased by wearing armor and equipping shields, while parry chance is increased by taking the parry action
	while wielding a melee weapon. </p>
<h4><a id="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h4>
<p>The final aspect of your character is their equipment. Equipment is categorized into weapons, gear, tools, and
	consumables. As you might expect, weapons deal damage and enable combat maneuvers while gear confers passive (often
	defensive) bonuses. Meanwhile, tools are usually reusable and convey minor bonuses, while consumables (such as
	potions and scrolls) convey more powerful one-time abilities. In most cases, your character will carry one or two
	weapons, some type of armor, and an adventurer's pack containing diverse and sundry items for the odd occasion.</p>
