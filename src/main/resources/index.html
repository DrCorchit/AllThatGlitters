<h3><a id="C1"></a>How do I play the game?</h3>
<p>All That Glitters, like any tabletop roleplaying system, has three parts: The players, the Dungeon Master, and the
	rulebook. Each part has a duty:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The players should understand the abilities of their characters, avoid cheating or metagaming, respect each
		other and the DM, and give the DM feedback so that problems don’t arise out of the blue.</p></li>
	<li><p>The DM should create a compelling setting, characters, and story and introduce challenging combat encounters
		while avoiding favoritism and respecting player agency. </p></li>
	<li><p>The rulebook should provide a framework where players can reason about the outcome of their actions and see
		their characters progressing in potency, and assist the DM in creating encounters that are both unique and
		appropriately difficult.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to play the game, you need a group of people who are willing to meet on a semi-regular basis for about 3-4
	hours. You also need someone to run the game: the Dungeon Master. If you’re reading this and you don’t know
	who your DM is, it’s probably you. <i>Be the DM you wish to see in the world.</i></p>
<h4><a id="C1S1"></a>Session Zero</h4>
<p>Once you have a group of friends and a DM, you should have a session zero. Session zero doesn’t have to be in-person;
	it can be a few text messages exchanged over the course of a few days. What matters is that everyone voices their
	expectations and ensures that they are compatible with their group before the first session.</p>
<p>Here are some important questions to discuss:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>What type of game do you want to play?</b><br/>Does your group want a lot of combat, a lot of story, or a mix
		of both? Do they want a main quest with a primary villain, or a sandbox world with a lot sidequests? Are
		problems like bandits in the countryside or necromancer cults part of an oncoming apocalypse, or merely
		business-as-usual? Having a single epic main quest can be fun, but the constant urgency tends to reduce player
		freedom. On the other hand, sandbox campaigns may feel unfocused and purposeless.
	</li>
	<li><b>Can player characters permanently die?</b><br/>Discuss player character death and total party kill (TPK)
		expectations. Are either of these outcomes possible? On the one hand, it can be heartbreaking to part with a
		beloved character. On the other hand, the possibility of player death leads to some extremely high stakes.
		Having the story end on a TPK is a very sour note; I think it is better for circumstances to intervene. However,
		having the possibility of true defeat does increase the authenticity of the threats.
	</li>
	<li><b>How do your characters meet?</b><br/>A tavern meeting is tried-and-true, but there are other options. Perhaps
		they’ve been enlisted by a local lord, jarl, or ealdorman to pursue some quest. Or maybe they've recently
		escaped from prison together, in which case one wonders whether they were falsely convicted, or are true
		scoundrels. Another possibility is that they were abducted and have awakened inside a labyrinth or cultist lair.
		Also, are any of the party natives to the starting area, or are they all foreigners? Can the players choose any
		race they want from the standard races list, or does the DM wish to create custom races to match a specific
		setting?
	</li>
	<li><b>What is the tone of the story?</b><br/>Do you want the story to be comedic, epic, grimdark, or realistic? How
		comfortable is your group with fantasy violence, sexuality, or politics? Oftentimes racism and sexism can make
		unsavory characters more compelling, but they may make some people in the group uncomfortable. Likewise,
		excessive humor at the wrong moments can ruin heart pounding moments of tension or suffocating dread.
	</li>
	<li><b>Are there any other concerns?</b><br/>For example, is player-versus-player combat allowed? (Not recommended.)
		Is this everyone’s first time playing the game, or is this a group of experienced players? Do you want to start
		at level 1, or higher?
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Once your group answers these questions, you’re ready to make your characters and start playing the game. Remember
	that most of these questions don’t have wrong answers—you can play whatever game you want to play.</p>
<h4><a id="C1S2"></a>The Game Cycle</h4>
<p>The game cycles between three states: narration, questioning, and action. During narration, the DM describes a
	situation, scene, or setting. At some point, the DM introduces one or more hooks that invite player interaction. For
	example, a suspicious NPC, a quest board at a tavern, a hallway branching into several mysterious passages, or even
	a crime being comitted.</p>
<p>Questioning happens after narration is complete, but before player have decided how they wish to respond. Players are
	usually trying to visualize the scene, probe for clues or hooks, or ask questions pertinent to their planned
	actions.</p>
<p>Once questioning is complete, the game moves into the action phase as the players tell the DM what they do.
	Sometimes, the DM simply narrates the outcome of these actions, completing the cycle. Other times, the action phase
	continues as the DM initiates either an event roll or a combat sequence.</p>
<h4><a id="C1S3"></a>Event Rolls </h4>
<p>An event roll happens when the DM determines that the outcome of some player's action depends on chance, usually
	related to the capabilities of their character. To perform an event roll, the DM first determines which aspect of
	the character will be tested, usually an attribute or a skill. An attribute check tests the raw abilities of a
	character, such as moving a heavy statue or sprinting quickly, while a skill check tests more applied abilities
	which may be improved through training, such as aiming a bow or haggling with a merchant.</p>
<p>The DM then asks the player to roll for that skill, while privately determining a difficulty threshold (DT) typically
	ranging from 1 to 20. In response, the player rolls a d20 and adds their associated attribute score modifier. If the
	sum is greater than or equal to the DT, the character’s action succeeds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: By tradition, rolling a 1 on a d20 is called a critical fail and results in an
	unusually bad outcome. Conversely, rolling a 20 is called a natural 20 and usually results in instant success.</p>
<p>If an event roll should have more than one potential outcome, the DM can add additional DT. For example, if the
	player is attempting to treat a wound, they may be asked to roll for medicine. The DM may decide that passing DT 12
	indicates that the player is able to fully clean the wound and stanch the bleeding. Below 12 but above 6, and the
	wound is treated but later develops an infection. In any case, the DM does not usually disclose what the difficulty
	threshold(s) are—only the outcome.</p>
<p>After the event roll is complete, the DM describes what has changed or transpired, returning to the narration
	phase.</p>
<h4><a id="C1S4"></a>Other Rules</h4>
<p>When rolling dice:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rolling with advantage means to roll a die twice and take the higher result.</li>
	<li>Rolling with disadvantage means to roll a die twice and take the lower result.</li>
	<li>Advantage and disadvantage each other cancel out.</li>
	<li>Rolling the middle means to roll a die three times and take the middle result.</li>
	<li>If a number comes up twice when rolling the middle, take the repeated number as the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>When rounding numbers, always round down.</p>
<p>When rules conflict, specifics override general rules.</p>
<h4>Abbreviations</h4>
<p>Throughout the game, several abbreviations are used to keep the text reasonably concise. These are the most
	common:</p>
<p>Combat:</p>
<ul>
	<li>HP: Health Points</li>
	<li>AP: Ability Points</li>
	<li>BC: Block Chance</li>
	<li>DC: Dodge Chance</li>
	<li>MIT: Mitigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>STR: Strength</li>
	<li>SPD: Speed</li>
	<li>DEX: Dexterity</li>
	<li>INT: Intelligence</li>
	<li>CHA: Charisma</li>
	<li>WILL: Willpower</li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul>
	<li>DM: Dungeon Master</li>
	<li>ASM: Attribute Score Modifier</li>
	<li>DT: Difficulty Threshold</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="C2"></a>What are my character's abilities?</h3>
<p>In All That Glitters, characters have several important aspects that determine what they can do in and out of
	combat:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#C2S1">Attributes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#C2S2">Skills</a></li>
	<li><a href="#C2S3">Proficiency Levels</a></li>
	<li><a href="#C2S4">Race, Class, and Size</a></li>
	<li><a href="#C2S5">Hit Points</a></li>
	<li><a href="#C2S6">Ability Points and Abilities</a></li>
	<li><a href="#C2S7">Mitigation</a></li>
	<li><a href="#C2S8">Equipment</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="C2S1"></a>Attributes</h4>
<p>The capabilities of player characters are determined by six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Speed, Intelligence,
	Charisma, and Willpower. Attributes describe the raw physical and mental capabilities of a player. For a given
	character, each attribute has a value, typically from 0 to 20. In general, a score of 0 indicates a total absence of
	the attribute (as with someone who is dead or unconscious) while a score of 20 indicates a nearly superhuman level
	of aptitude. For humans, a score of ten indicates an average level of proficiency.</p>
<p>Each attribute has an associated hard cap and soft cap. A player can surpass the soft cap only through strenuous
	training, necessarily neglecting other attributes to do so. The hard cap cannot be surpassed through any amount of
	training, however. For humans, the soft cap for each ability is at 16, and the hard cap is at 20. Racial bonuses to
	any attribute increase both the soft and hard cap by the same amount. For example, since dwarves receive a +2 bonus
	to strength, they can later increase their strength to 22, surpassing the human limit of 20, because their racial
	bonus has increased both their hard and soft caps for that attribute. The effect also works in reverse: dwarves take
	a penalty to speed, and so cannot train their speed stat beyond 19.</p>
<table>
	<tr>

		<th>What it measures</th>
		<th>Gameplay Effects</th>
		<th>Real-life Equivalence</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Strength</td>
		<td>Core physical body power</td>
		<td>Melee weapon damage and hitpoints</td>
		<td>10 Strength equals 100 lbs deadlift weight. Each additional point is a ~25% increase in deadlift weight.

		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Willpower</td>

		<td>Natural Spell power and ability points</td>
		<td>N/A</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><br/>In addition to these effects, each attribute supports one or more skills, which are used during event rolls.
	Importantly, each attribute affects multiple aspects of gameplay, meaning that players should care about which stats
	they prioritize and which they neglect. Not every character needs to be well-rounded, but characters with unusual
	ability score distributions should feel somewhat unbalanced to play.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: In most situations, we do not use the attribute score directly, but the attribute
	score modifier (ASM). The ASM for an attribute is obtained by subtracting 10 from the attribute score. An average
	human with 10 for all attribute scores would thus have 0 for their attribute score modifiers.</p>
<h4><a id="C2S2"></a>Skills</h4>
<p>Skills are related to attributes in that they are also used for event rolls. Every skill has an underlying supporting
	attribute, whose ASM is added to the roll as with an attribute check. In addition to this, players add a bonus from
	training called a proficiency bonus. The number rolled on the d20 plus the ASM plus the proficency bonus determine
	the final value for the event roll.</p>
<p>Although every skill depends on at least one attribute, several skills have a secondary supporting attribute whose
	modifier may be used instead, under certain circumstances. For example, a player who is sneaking may decide that
	they are too clumsy to move quietly and instead opt to sprint past the guard while his gaze is turned. In this case,
	the player is trying to use their ASM for speed instead of dexterity for the stealth check. Whether this type of
	substitution is used is situational. In fact, certain circumstances <i>require</i>that the alternative attribute
	score modifier is used, while others permit it, in which case it would only be used if the second attribute’s score
	is higher for that character.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all skills:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Skill Name</th>
		<th>Supporting Attributes</th>
		<th>Explanation</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Accuracy</td>
		<td>Dex</td>
		<td>Describes a player’s accuracy with bows, crossbows, and gunpowder weapons. Proficiency bonuses for this
			skill affect attack rolls with ranged weapons.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Defense</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Performance</td>
		<td>Cha/Dex</td>
		<td>The players ability to sing, dance, play instruments, or otherwise entertain a crowd. Performance is also
			used when attempting to display proper manners before a royal court. Dexterity should be used only in cases
			where the player is attempting to entertain a crowd with acrobatic feats.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Persuasion</td>
		<td>Cha</td>
		<td>Used to convince others to change their beliefs or intended course of action, whether through factual debate
			or outright deception. Intelligence should only be used as the base attribute if the player is able to
			present a rational argument and both conversants would likely understand.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Perception</td>
		<td>Int/Cha</td>
		<td>The ability to notice out-of-place objects or people, traps, and recognize partially obscured or remote
			objects. When attempting to perceive a character’s honesty or motives, charisma becomes the base stat.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sleight-of-Hand</td>
		<td>Dex</td>
		<td>Used for lockpicking and pickpocketing items, or other such tricks.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Stealth</td>
		<td>Dex/Spd</td>
		<td>Used for sneaking or attempting to perform actions without being seen. Speed can be used if the noise of
			sprinting is unlikely to arouse excessive suspicion.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Survival</td>
		<td>Will</td>
		<td>The ability to stay alive, including the ability to hunt and live off the land.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Certain skills have special applications. For example, persuasion can be used to haggle with merchants, as follows:
	The player may attempt to haggle with a merchant up to three times, with successively higher DT for each successful
	haggle. If the player fails any haggle, they cannot continue to haggle and the discount for that item is not
	increased further. If the player rolls a critical fail on any haggle, the merchant becomes irritated and removes all
	discounts completely.</p>
<p>After attempting to haggle a merchant, the same merchant will not allow themselves to be haggled again for some time,
	unless they are fond of the adventuring party or from a culture where haggling is expected.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Haggle Attempt</th>
		<th>DT</th>
		<th>Price Reduction</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>15</td>
		<td>15%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>20</td>
		<td>30%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>25</td>
		<td>50%</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h4><a id="C2S3"></a>Proficiency Levels</h4>
<p>There are five levels of proficiency in each skill, as follows:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Deficiency</td>
		<td>-2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Proficiency</td>
		<td>2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Expertise</td>
		<td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mastery</td>
		<td>6</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Each of these labels indicate that the player has either undertaken training or has an especial weakness in that
	skill. Deficiencies can be overcome and expertise and mastery can be attained through training even after a
	character is made.</p>
<p>When players obtain proficiency bonuses to the same skill from multiple sources, they do not combine to advance one’s
	proficiency in that skill to the next level. The only exception to this rule is that proficiency bonuses from a
	player’s race and class can be combined, allowing a player to begin the game with expert level in that skill.</p>
<h4><a id="C2S4"></a>Race, Class, and Size</h4>
<p>Every character belongs to a race, which provides certain starting bonuses and determines the limits of their
	attribute scores. Race cannot be changed after a character is created. Examples of races include humans, elves, and
	dwarves.</p>
<p>A character’s race also determines their size class, ranging from tiny to huge. Size primarily affects what weapons a
	character can and can’t use, and how effectively they can grapple. Grappling will be explained in further detail in
	the combat section.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Size</th>
		<th>Maximum Height</th>
		<th>Grid Size</th>
		<th>Restrictions</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tiny</td>
		<td>2 feet</td>
		<td>0x0</td>
		<td>May not wield ordinary weapons (except daggers).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Small</td>
		<td>4 feet</td>
		<td>1x1</td>
		<td>May not wield versatile or great weapons.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Medium</td>
		<td>8 feet</td>
		<td>1x1</td>
		<td><br/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Large</td>
		<td>16 feet</td>
		<td>2x2</td>
		<td><br/></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Huge</td>
		<td>32 feet</td>
		<td>3x3</td>
		<td>May not wield ordinary weapons (except great weapons).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Enormous</td>
		<td>No Maximum</td>
		<td>4x4</td>
		<td>May not wield ordinary weapons.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>In addition to a race, each character has a class, which determines how they fight. Character’s classes confer some
	bonuses immediately, but most bonuses are unlocked as the player levels up. Unlike race, classes can be changed
	after a character is created, under certain circumstances.</p>
<h4><a id="C2S5"></a>Hit Points</h4>
<p>Hit points (HP) are a resource that cause the player to fall unconscious when depleted. Since the character cannot
	move or fight when unconscious, keeping HP from falling to zero is extremely important. There are two sets of rules
	that govern what happens when a player falls unconscious: permadeath and modern.</p>
<p>Under permadeath rules, once the player has been downed, they roll a d20 every time it is their turn in combat. Every
	roll of a 10 or higher is considered a save, while every roll of 9 or lower is considered a fail. If the character
	makes three saves, they become stable and do not need to make additional saves to stay alive. However, if a
	character accumulates three fails, they are dead and can only be revived by powerful resurrection magic. Under this
	system, players can be revived and resume fighting after being healed by any healing spell, regardless of how many
	saves they have failed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Under permadeath rules, rolling a natural 20 immediately causes the player to become
	stable.</p>
<p>The modern rules offer an alternative system where unconscious players do not need to make saving throws to stay
	alive. However, they also do not regain consciousness after being healed by healing magic. Instead, they regain
	consciousness 1d4 hours after combat is over.</p>
<p>In gameplay strategy, modern rules prioritize keeping the characters conscious, making single-target healing spells
	quite valuable. Permadeath rules favor mass healing spells that resurrect the character whenever they fall. You
	should think carefully about which system works best for you.</p>
<p>A character’s HP cannot exceed their maximum HP stat. Initially, maximum HP is equal to the strength attribute, but
	it increases over time as a character levels up. The precise amount will be explained in more detail in the section
	on character leveling. All missing HP is restored after a long rest, while only one-half is restored after a short
	rest.</p>
<h4><a id="C2S6"></a>Abilities and Ability Points</h4>
<p>Ability points (AP) are similar to HP in that both are depleted during combat, recovered by resting, and have a
	maximum amount that increases as players level. AP are expended as the player uses powerful spells and abilities.
	When AP is fully depleted, the character is said to be exhausted. There is not an immediate penalty for this
	condition, other than not being able to use critically necessary abilities.</p>
<p>Like HP, all missing AP are restored after a long rest. Unlike HP, only one-third of missing attribute points are
	restored after a short rest. Maximum AP is affected by the willpower stat similarly to the way maximum HP is
	affected by the strength stat.</p>
<p>Abilities are learned or innate skills that confer some benefit to the player, such as spells, combat maneuvers, or
	proficiency improvements. Abilities are categorized in a few ways. First, abilities acquired from a player’s class
	(such as the barbarian’s rage) are called innate abilities. Abilities learned from trainers are called trained
	abilities, and finally trained abilities which have been fully mastered are called rote abilities. </p>
<p>Abilities are also classified by whether or not they are explicitly invoked by the player or if they take effect
	automatically. The former are called active abilities and usually cost AP to activate, while the latter are called
	passive abilities (or perks) and take effect without the use of AP.</p>
<p>An example of a passive ability would be a perk that restores HP at the start of the player’s turn. Since the player
	is not required to do anything to receive this benefit, it is passive. On the other hand, an ability that allows the
	player to spend AP to deal extra damage would be an active ability.</p>
<h4><a id="C2S7"></a>Mitigation</h4>
<p>Mitigation is a derived statistic which determines how likely a player is to successfully dodge or block an attack,
	similar to armor class from DnD. During combat, melee and ranged attacks are treated as an event roll testing the
	martial arts or accuracy skill, respectively. In this situation, mitigation provides the difficulty threshold for
	whether the attack succeeds. Thus, players with high mitigation are hit less often and therefore survive longer.</p>
<p>Mitigation is composed primarily of two values: dodge chance (DC), conferred by the player’s dexterity attribute, and
	block chance (BC), conferred by the player’s shields, armor and defense skill profiency. A third value, parry
	chance, is less common but used when a player is actively attempting to parry an attack. The three values are added
	together to calculate total mitigation, but certain attacks may bypass some or all of the three values, reducing
	effective mitigation against that tactic. For example, most types of armor are not ideal for absorbing blows from
	blunt weapons. Accordingly, bludgeoning damage automatically bypasses half of the target’s BC.</p>
<p>The player’s DC is normally equal to their dexterity attribute, while BC and parry chance start at zero. Block chance
	is increased by wearing armor and equipping shields, while parry chance is increased by taking the parry action
	while wielding a melee weapon. </p>
<h4><a id="C2S8"></a>Equipment</h4>
<p>The final aspect of each player character is their equipment. Equipment categorized into weapons, gear, and items,
	which are further subcategorized by use.</p>
<p><a href="#Appendix_Weapons">Weapons</a> fall into five categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Small Weapons (Daggers, improvised) </p></li>
	<li><p>Standard Weapons (Swords, Maces, Morningstars) </p></li>
	<li><p>Great Weapons (Longswords, Greataxes, Polearms)</p></li>
	<li><p>Ranged (Longbow, Crossbow, Musket, Javelin)</p></li>
	<li><p>Special Weapons (Shields, Whips, Flails, Hook Swords)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A player can carry up to two weapons, as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>A single greatweapon, carried in a two-handed grip</p></li>
	<li><p>A standard weapon and a shield</p></li>
	<li><p>A standard weapon, plus a small weapon in the offhand</p></li>
	<li><p>Two light weapons, such as two shortswords </p></li>
	<li><p>Two small weapons, such as two daggers </p></li>
	<li><p>Any standard or small weapon, with the offhand kept free in order to cast spells</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Gear falls into these categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Armor</p></li>
	<li><p>Clothing</p></li>
	<li><p>Jewelry</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Items fall into these categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Potions</p></li>
	<li><p>Scrolls</p></li>
	<li><p>Tools</p></li>
	<li><p>Other</p></li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="C3"></a>How does my character fight?</h3>
<p>Combat is pure chaos. It's nothing like the movies; you won't find any choreographed fencing with somersaults and
	pirouettes, dramatic music, or witty banter. Real combat is full of noise and blood and grime, broken bones, and the
	screams of the dying—or the eerie silence of the dead. Be that as it may, mortal combat is actually the pinnacle of
	problem-solving on a great many worlds. So you'd better get good at it.</p>
<p>In order to make sense out of chaos, combat is divided into <i>turns</i> and <i>rounds</i>. A turn of combat captures
	a single fighter doing their best to kill and not be killed for a single 5-second snapshot of time. Meanwhile, a
	round is completed when all combatants have completed their turn. Turns do not happen simultaneously, but in order
	of initiative, which will be explained shortly. Once combat has started, it continues through as many rounds as it
	needs to until only one faction remains, and all others have either surrendered, fled, or been slain. Then it ends,
	as quickly as it began.</p>
<p>In addition to turns and rounds, we often use a grid to make sense out of the way monsters and playe</p>


<h4></h4>
<ol></ol>
<p>Combat begins with a skill check, as both players and npc combatants roll for initiative. In <i>All That Glitters</i>,
	rolling for initiative is an ordinary event roll, and therefore all other rules such as proficiency bonuses apply.
	When two characters roll the same initiative, players move before monsters, and two players rolling the same
	initiative may either reach an agreement about who moves first or roll a d20 to decide. Monsters rolling the same
	initiative move in whatever order the DM decides.</p>
<p>Optionally, the DM may decide to allow players to roll for recognition to see the stats of the monsters they are
	about to fight. This check depends on the survival skill and its DT is determined by the rarity of the monsters in
	question:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Monster Rarity</th>
		<th>Interpretation</th>
		<th>Typical DT</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Common</td>
		<td>The monster's physicalities are thoroughly documented in literature, and its attacks are an (at least)
			annual occurance.
		</td>
		<td>18</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rare</td>
		<td>The monster has been seen before, but not studied thoroughly. It may have been years to decades since the
			last sighting.
		</td>
		<td>24</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Legendary</td>
		<td>The monster has not been sighted in perhaps a century or more. Many doubt that it still exists, or ever
			existed.
		</td>
		<td>30</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The recognition roll is normally made with disadvantage if the area is obscured by heavy fog or darkness. Conversely,
	players may roll with advantage if attempting to discern monsters that emit distinctive noises or smells. If
	successful, the players gain knowledge of the monster's HP, attacks, and mitigation stat, and any other information
	the DM chooses to reveal. If there are several monsters attacking together, the roll should be done in one go rather
	than rolling again for each unique type of monster in the encounter.</p>
<p>After initiative and recognition are rolled, combatants begin to take turns in order of their initiative score.
	Combat then proceeds until the last monster has acted, completing the first round of combat. Subsequent rounds
	proceed in the same fashion, with characters and monsters taking turns attacking each other until only one faction
	remains, at which point combat ends.</p>
<p style="margin-left=25px">Note: Sometimes, players may have a chance to view their enemies from a distance before they
	are recognized. In this case, they may roll for recognition before combat begins, usually with advantage.</p>
<p>During an ambush or surprise attack, sometimes one side is so completely discombobulated that they are unable to
	defend themselves decisively. This condition is called "surprise" and has the following effects: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Characters automatically cannot make recognition rolls</li>
	<li>Surprised characters have disadvantage on the initiative roll.</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Each combat round corresponds roughly to 5 seconds of time in the game world.</p>
<h4><a id="C3S1"></a>Actions</h4>
<p>At the beginning of every combat turn, players gain one main hand action, one offhand action, and movement points
	equal to one half their speed attribute. The various actions taken during the turn deplete these resources until the
	player has no more abilities to use, at which point their turn ends. Monsters may have more or fewer actions that
	human players, but otherwise their combat turns proceed in essentially the same way.</p>
<p>In addition to these, combatants possess hit points and AP. Hit points are related to the strength stat, and the
	character or monster falls unconscious when they are reduced to zero. AP are related to the willpower stat, and are
	expended as the player or monster uses special abilities. When a character has zero AP, they are said to be
	exhausted, but there is not usually a penalty for this condition.</p>

<h4><a id="C3S2"></a>Attacking</h4>
<p>The actions most commonly taken during a turn are those that deal damage. Attacks are handled in two parts, the first
	being an attack roll to determine whether the attack connects, and the second being a damage roll to determine how
	much damage is dealt. The attack roll is an ordinary skill check for either martial arts (for melee) or accuracy
	(for ranged). The DT of the attack roll is the mitigation stat of the target.</p>
<p>To determine the damage of an attack which has connected, the player rolls that weapon’s damage dice and adds the
	ability score modifier to the total value. Each weapon has a unique damage die and one or more attack attributes.
	For example, a dagger’s damage die is a d4 and its attribute is dexterity. A player with a dexterity score of 12
	rolling a 4 on a 1d4 would deal a total of 6 damage—4 from the weapon die, and 2 from their dexterity ASM. To give
	another example, a pike has a damage die of d12 and either speed or strength may be used as its attribute. A
	character with 14 speed rolling an 8 on the d12 would deal a total of 12 damage with their pike.</p>
<p>Attack rules for spells are different and depend on the precise spell in question. Many spells partially or
	completely bypass ordinary mitigation or hit an entire area at once. In such cases, the target usually tries to pass
	a skill check to avoid full damage, rather than the caster trying to pass an ability check to cast the spell.</p>
<h4><a id="C3S3"></a>Moving</h4>
<p>When moving around on a rectangular battle grid, the player expends 1 movement point for every vertical, horizontal,
	or diagonal move. Optionally, players can agree that diagonal movement costs 1.5 movement points. This effectively
	makes reachable tiles more circular and makes fractional movement points more relevant, but also increases the
	complexity of combat. In any case, a character cannot enter a tile unless they have the required amount of movement
	points remaining. For example, a character with 5.5 movement points would be able to move at most 5 tiles
	horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>In a 5-second combat round with 5-foot square tiles, a speed of 10 (average) translates to 5 feet per second, or
	around 3.5 miles per hours. This implies a typical jog speed of 7 miles per hour, and a sprint speed of 14 miles per
	hours.</p>
<h4><a id="C3S4"></a>Grappling</h4>
<p>A player can attempt to grapple an enemy by using both a main and offhand action. If they are able to pass a martial
	arts check with a DT of enemy’s strength attribute, the grapple is successful. In this event, the grappled creature
	cannot move or take main or offhand actions during their turn. However, they can roll a martial arts check with a DT
	equal to the player’s strength attribute. If they succeed, they are no longer grappled and will be able to move and
	act normally on their next turn. </p>
<p>Note that relative size affects grappling chances. If a player attempts to grapple a smaller enemy, they gain
	advantage on the martial arts check, while if they attempt to grapple a larger enemy, they gain disadvantage. No
	character may grapple a character more than one size class larger than they are.</p>
<p>If a player is grappling an enemy at the start of their turn, they may drag, throw, or release the enemy. While
	dragging, the player moves at half speed and cannot take any other actions. The player can attempt to throw the
	enemy by making a strength check, with the </p>
<p>Finally, a player can choose to release a grappled enemy. This does not cost a main or offhand action, but the player
	will have to pass another martial arts check to grapple the creature again. Players have advantage on attacks
	against creatures they have just released from being grappled.</p>
<h4><a id="C3S5"></a>Reacting</h4>
<p>Reactions are special moves that happen in response to specific triggers, such as an enemy moving into or out of
	melee range. Reactions take effect before a player’s next turn, and give the player the option to expend actions for
	their pending turn to make special moves. Each player may take only one reaction per turn, and using a reaction
	expends some of the actions that would normally be available on their next turn.</p>
<p>For example, if a player is engaged in melee combat with a monster that chooses to run away, the player can make a
	special move called an opportunity attack to punish the monster for turning its back on an attacker. This allows the
	player to deal the damage of an full attack while only expending an offhand action. However, on their next turn they
	will only have a main hand action, since their offhand action was used to damage the escaping monster. If that
	player decides to consume a potion on their next turn, they would have to expend a main hand action to do so,
	instead of the usual offhand action.</p>
<p>Most monsters are also capable of scoring opportunity attacks against players, but players can use the disengage
	action to avoid this. Disengage allows the player to move out of melee range without triggering the opportunity
	attack reaction, useful for repositioning.</p>
<a id="C3S6"></a><h4>Damage Types</h4>
<p>Smashing, slashing, poisoning, burning… There are quite a few ways to do someone in. Here's a list of damage types
	and their unique effects:</p>
<p>Common damage types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Slashing</b>: Liable to cause bleeding.</li>
	<li><b>Bludgeoning</b>: More effective versus plate armors.</li>
	<li><b>Piercing</b>: More effective versus mail armors.</li>
	<li><b>Fire</b>: Liable to cause burning.</li>
	<li><b>Freezing</b>: Reduces and dexterity.</li>
	<li><b>Lightning</b>: Ignores metal armor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rare damage types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Acid/Corrosive</b>: Causes armor damage which must later be repaired at a smithy.</li>
	<li><b>Light/Holy</b>: Causes extra damage to undead and evil aligned creatures.</li>
	<li><b>Dark/Profane</b>: Causes extra damage to good-aligned creatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good-aligned characters possess resistance to holy damage, and evil-aligned characters possess resistance to profane
	damage.</p>
<p>Explosions usually deal a mix of damage types, usually bludgeoning and a magical damage types.</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">Note: poison is not a damage type. Poison attacks deal unique effects depending on their
	type. Those that damage the victim over time inflict acid damage (but do not damage armor).</p>
<p>
	Poison effects: Neurotoxic -> Reduce willpower Hallucinogenic -> confusion or frenzy Paralytic -> Paralysis
	Blindness Amnesia Onset? </p>
<h4><a id="C3S7"></a>Status Effects</h4>
<p>During combat, sometimes characters fall prey to certain temporary conditions that reduce their effectiveness in
	combat.</p>

<h3><a id="C4"></a>How does my character become stronger?</h3>
<p>In All That Glitters, there are three ways that characters increase their power level: leveling, training, and
	looting. The main difference between these systems is that leveling provides guaranteed and predictable bonuses,
	while looting provides more irregular and chaotic bonuses that players cannot foresee. The bonuses from leveling
	promote planning and ambition, while the bonuses from looting are unique to each adventure, and promote character
	identity. Contrasting these, training allows players to take control of their own destinies and acquire the
	abilities they deem most useful.</p>
<h4><a id="C4S1"></a>Leveling</h4>
<p>Each character’s skill as an adventurer is measured by their level, which typically begins at 1 and progresses up to
	20. Typically, all characters in a party level up together, usually after a huge battle or major obstacle is
	overcome as the DM recognizes the adventuring party’s increasing skill and renown. This is known as milestone
	leveling. When leveling, players gain two types of bonuses: attribute training and class features. </p>
<p>As a result of training, players may increase two of their attribute scores by one, if the increase does not put
	either attribute above the soft cap for that character. If the player wishes to increase an ability beyond the soft
	cap, they may only increase one attribute score.</p>
<p>As part of attribute training, players increase their maximum HP and AP according to their strength and willpower
	scores, according to the following chart:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Attribute Level</th>
		<th>HP or AP per level</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1-3</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4-5</td>
		<td>1+1d4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>6-7</td>
		<td>2+1d4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8-9</td>
		<td>2+1d6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>10-11</td>
		<td>3+1d6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>12-13</td>
		<td>3+1d8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>14-15</td>
		<td>4+1d8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>16-17</td>
		<td>4+1d10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>18-19</td>
		<td>5+1d10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>20+</td>
		<td>5+1d12</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>When rolling for max HP or AP, players should roll the middle. Meaning, roll three dice and take the middle result.
	This reduces the occurrence of extreme values, which can be frustrating at low levels.</p>
<p>In addition to the attribute, HP, and AP bonuses, players gain unique bonuses (called class features) based upon
	their chosen combat class. These bonuses are discussed further in the next chapter, on creating a character.</p>
<h4><a id="C4S2"></a>Training and Training Slots</h4>
<p>It is possible for characters to proactively learn many abilities from NPC trainers, such as skill proficiencies,
	combat tactics, and spells. In addition to any gold cost, learning abilities in this way costs training slots. Each
	player has training slots equal to their intelligence score, which represent the time and mental effort required to
	fully master the new skill. Most abilities consume four training slots at first, but that number is reduced by half
	every time the player levels up, rounded down. After leveling up, any trained abilities that consume only one
	training slot become rote abilities, and no longer consume training slots. </p>
<p>If a player does not have enough training slots available to learn a new ability, they cannot learn the ability even
	if they have sufficient gold to purchase the training. In this case, players can choose to forget abilities they are
	in the process of learning. If this is done, the training slots for the forgotten ability are recovered but the gold
	use to purchase the ability is lost and the skill can no longer be used.</p>
<p>In order to learn new abilities, players must first ensure that they meet the requirements of the ability they are
	trying to learn. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Many abilities require a certain level of strength or intelligence, or other attribute.</p></li>
	<li><p>Some abilities require a level of proficiency in a certain skill.</p></li>
	<li><p>High level spells often require mastery of other low level spells before they can be learned.</p></li>
	<li><p>Players must have sufficient training slots available for the ability they are trying to learn.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming they meet these requirements, players must find and hire a trainer of the appropriate discipline and skill
	level. After this, the new ability is gained, and can be used at any point in the adventure.</p>
<h4><a id="C4S3"></a>Looting</h4>
<p>Looting refers to the acquisition of gold, weapons, armor, and magical items during the adventure. Importantly,
	looting—and in particular, the acquisition of gold—is considered a part of the leveling process itself rather than a
	mere footnote. Because gold is so closely connected with training, DMs usually provide players a certain amount of
	gold per level, as indicated in the following chart:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Party Level</th>
		<th>Gold per player</th>
		<th>Typical Expenditures</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0-50</td>
		<td>The party is focused on basic spell and ability training</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2-3</td>
		<td>50-100</td>
		<td>The party continues to train spells and abilities, while beginning to explore enchanted gadgets and
			consumables
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4-5</td>
		<td>100-200</td>
		<td>The party begins upgrading weapons and armor to improved metals such as titanium.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>6-7</td>
		<td>200-300</td>
		<td>As players reach the soft caps for their attributes, elite attribute training becomes useful.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8-10</td>
		<td>300-500</td>
		<td>The party fully progresses beyond steel weaponry to mithril and adamant.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>11-15</td>
		<td>500-1000</td>
		<td>Players hone their skill sets and may pursue attribute training: Olympian.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>16+</td>
		<td>1000+</td>
		<td>The party focuses primarily on the acquisition of rare and powerful trinkets and armor.</td>
	</tr>

<h4><a id="C5S1"></a>Races</h4>
<p>I provide seven example races here, representing some of my favorite repeat offenders in the fantasy genre. That
	said, homebrewing new races is very much in the spirit of All that Glitters, and if a race you want to play isn’t in
	this list, you absolutely should create it. Alternatively, feel free to create your own lore for any of these
	races—don’t let my ideas stifle yours! Further on, I’ll explain some guidelines for creating new races (without
	upsetting gameplay balance).</p>
<p>Without further ado:</p>
<a id="C5S1_Human"></a><h5>Human</h5>
<p>Overall, humans are proud, robust, and athletic. I daresay we are altogether quite handsome. Men average around 5’9”
	in height; women around 5’4”. Weight varies greatly, usually between 100-200 lbs. We live between 70 and 90 years,
	if we do not die in one of our many wars.</p>
<p>Although we humans may seem an uninspiring choice to some, it’s all a matter of perspective. To dwarves, we are tall
	and regal. To elves, we are robust and warlike. Among saurids, we are called slow and loud. And so it goes.</p>
<p>Human characters start with a single bonus point in an ability of their choice, and may take a level of proficiency
	in any skill.</p>
<a id="C5S1_Elf"></a><h5>Elf</h5>
<p>Graceful and elegant, elves exemplify much of what humans aspire to be. In height, male elves average about 6’3”;
	female elves about 5’9”. Weight varies between 120-200 lbs. They are barely heavier than humans, despite their
	increased stature. The gods have truly blessed their race: they live around 200 years at least, and some (of the
	royal line) as long as five hundred.</p>
<p>Over time, their kind has diverged into three bloodlines. Descendants of the royal bloodline are called Eldarii and
	excel in magic and all manner of letters. They incorporate magic into nearly every level of society. As a
	consequence, even their young children know basic spells. They are invariably blonde haired and fair skinned, and
	persistently arrogant. Some of them attempt to repent their hubris, but I have come to prefer the frank honesty of
	arrogance to a feigned humility.</p>
<p>Members of the common line are called Numenarii, and pursue archery, hunting, fishing, and farming. They have
	interbred on occasion with humans, and so take on darker hair and skin tones. They imitate the arrogance of the
	Eldarii, though it is but a veneer: they are quite insecure.</p>
<p>Members of the third bloodline are called Drow, and are descended from the line of the nameless usurper. Tales of
	their cruelty are exaggerated, but not by much. Their skin is bluish gray, and their hair silver. They do not spare
	themselves from their own ruthless designs, and many attempt to escape their subterranean holds. Those few who do
	often become brave adventurers. </p>
<p>All elven characters suffer a -1 penalty to strength, and gain bonuses depending on their bloodline. Those of the
	royal line gain +2 INT and knowledge of a level 1 spell, plus proficiency in literacy, along with deficiency in
	survival. Members of the common line gain +2 DEX and proficiency in nature and accuracy. Drow gain +2 WILL and
	proficiency in perception and stealth. Drow also have the gift of darkvision.</p>
<a id="C5S1_Dwarf"></a><h5>Dwarf</h5>
<p>A short and ruddy race. Male dwarves average around 5 feet in height, while their females average around 4’8”.
	Despite their stature, they weigh between 100-160 lbs. It is customary for their men to grow long beards, though
	beards longer than twenty inches are seldom seen outside storybooks. They live a bit longer than humans, so a
	century and a half is not out of the question.</p>
<p>The dwarves of yore possessed insatiable bloodthirst and fought man, elf, and dragon alike in a great many wars.
	Times have changed, and they have been at peace nigh on two millennia. They are now greatly concerned with the
	exploration of mountains and caves, the industry of mining, and the acquisition of gold.</p>
<p>Despite their unusual habits and short stature, dwarves are actually a fairly well balanced race that can excel in
	many roles. Dwarves gain +1 STR and +1 WILL at the cost of -2 SPD, and choose an additional +1 in STR or WILL. Also,
	dwarves have a keen sense for gold and have advantage on perception and persuasion checks when searching for
	treasure or bartering with merchants. All dwarves have proficiency in defense.</p>
<a id="C5S1_Halfling"></a><h5>Halfling</h5>
<p>The shortest of the races, halfling men average 3’9” in height. Their women are yet shorter, scantly 3’6” by average.
	A tall halfling may resemble a short dwarf, though the former will be discernible by his slender build and wispy
	facial hair, if he has any at all. Halflings weigh only 50-100 lbs, and I’ll wager a drink you can’t find a heavier
	one in under a fortnight. They are somewhat long lived, often lasting a bit more than a century.</p>
<p>As timeless as their quaint and cozy country villages may seem, they are no strangers to change. Nearly half of them
	are now second or third generation immigrants in large cities. They are unwelcome there on account of their ill
	reputation: it is said that nearly a third of them are criminals. As thieves, they are exceedingly sly.</p>
<p>Halflings tend to be unbalanced characters, having a -2 penalty to STR and a -2 penalty to SPD. They make up for this
	with a +2 to DEX, and another +2 to INT, CHA, or WILL. Urban halflings start with proficiency in parkour and sleight
	of hand, while rural halflings start with proficiency in nature and survival. </p>
<a id="C5S1_Orc"></a><h5>Orc</h5>
<p>Stout and rippling with muscle, orcs are warriors to the last. Their menfolk are nearly as tall as the elves, around
	6’, and their women are barely any shorter, around 5’10”. Fully grown, they weigh somewhere between 180 to 300
	lbs—quite formidable! Their hair is almost invariably black or gray, while their skin ranges from dark green to pale
	yellow or gray. In years, they may reach 60 if they are lucky; usually less. They make up for this by living with
	what I will graciously call ‘extreme vigor’.</p>
<p>The history of orcs is full of long and bloody intertribal conflicts. Despite this, they have made steady progress as
	a species and have transitioned from cave dwellings to small villages, then larger villages, until now many think to
	mingle with humans, dwarves, and halflings on the frontiers of civilization. (Elves will have none of their ilk.)
	They are well-suited to mercenary or guard work. They make poor thieves or wizards. </p>
<p>Orcs gain +2 to STR and WILL, at the cost of -1 to DEX and -1 INT, and an addional -1 to either INT or CHA. They have
	proficiency in intimidation and survival.</p>
<a id="C5S1_Tiefling"></a><h5>Tiefling</h5>
<p>Of middling stature and musculature, tieflings are nearly human. Yet as the saying goes, ‘so close and yet so far.’
	By virtue of their debauched bloodline (the devil-dealings of their ancestors being no small secret) they are cursed
	with horns, pointed ears, and skin of a blood-red hue (or other outrageous colors). Almost everywhere, they are
	shunned by all ‘good’ folk. Yet I think they can be accorded a little understanding, for they are neither warlike
	nor pompous, and wisely take their poor lot in life with a dose of good humor. </p>
<p>It is difficult to give a straightforward account of their physical nature, because it is so widely varied. I have
	seen some as short as 5’ and others as tall as 6’8”. Their are neither particularly bulky nor slender, and so their
	weight is comparable to that of a human. Only in longevity have the gods relented, granting them perhaps 110 years,
	around the same span as a halfling.</p>
<p>Tieflings typically live in colonies suitably removed from human and elven settlements. They have dealings with
	dwarves and halflings, who treat them fairly. They quietly pursue industry and keep to themselves, but their young
	oft grow weary of their meek ways and seek adventure and companionship abroad. </p>
<p>Tieflings gain +1 to CHA and DEX, and an additional +1 to INT or CHA, at the cost of -2 WILL. They possess the gift
	of darkvision, and can see in total darkness to a range of 3 yards, or dim light to about 30 yards. They have
	proficiency in performance and either medicine or perception.</p>
<a id="C5S1_Aarakocra"></a><h5>Aarakocra</h5>
<p>Flighty and covered with feathers, the Aarakocra are an extremely vibrant and colorful race. There are as many
	sub-races of these as of man or elf; it seems that many take after some species of bird or another. So you have one
	with feathers of azure and gold, another crimson, cream, and jade, and a third black as a raven. In general, they
	are about the size of a man, but extraordinarily light. I think 5'6" is a typical height, but they weigh less than
	80 pounds. Their longevity varies greatly, and some have a span of up to 250 years, rivaling even the elves.
	However, this is not common and I have met very few over the age of ninety or so.</p>
<p>On my travels, I have observed that Aarakocra races and tribes can be roughly divided into two categories: raptors
	and songbirds. The former are taller and stronger, and possess extremely keen hearing and sight. As for the
	songbirds, they are extremely quick with their limbs and can mimic almost any sound they hear. They have a
	reputation for bing tricksters, and are in the habit of gathering shiny things, as their brothers the ravens and
	crows do.</p>
<p>Aarakocra gain a +2 bonus to SPD, but -2 to STR. All aarakocra can glide and are immune to fall damage. Raptors gain
	+1 STR and proficiency in perception, while songbirds gain +1 DEX and proficiency in performance.</p>
<a id="C5S1_Saurid"></a><h5>Saurid</h5>
<p>Slinking, skulking, scurrying—these are words befitting a saurid. Treading the slender line between man and beast,
	they are a fierce folk. As much lizard as man, they possess scaly hides, long tails, and snouts lined with razor
	sharp teeth. Some say they are cruel, but I having observed them closely on more than one occasion, I would rather
	describe them as practical.</p>
<p>A saurid is typically shorter than a man, but they grow all their lives until extreme old age. Some can become quite
	large. Their females are a bit taller and more muscular than their males. In terms of height, they reach about 5’6”
	while the male might reach only 5’2 or so. They are not long lived, and seventy years is a ripe age for a
	saurid.</p>
<p>The saurids I have seen are fairly xenophobic, and live in colonies inside caves usually near water. They hunt, fish,
	and raise their hatchlings quietly, having few dealings with man or elf, except for the occasional territorial
	clash. They have developed a unique sort of architecture, and their colonies are quite remarkable, often lavishly
	decorated with precious stones and cut stone. Their predilection for gathering all things shiny has attracted
	dwarven traders, which has brought the common tongue to their knowledge. Many of them now seek adventure abroad,
	bringing with them their fearsome and curious ways.</p>
<p>Saurids gain +2 to STR and SPD, at the cost of -2 INT and -1 CHA. They possess the gift of darkvision, able to see in
	near total darkness. They have deficiency in literacy, but may take proficiency in two out of initiative, stealth,
	or perception.</p>
<p>When creating new races, consider following these general:</p>
<ol>
	<li>No stat bonus should exceed +2, and no stat penalty should exceed -2.</li>
	<li>The sum of all racial bonuses minus all penalties should equal 1.</li>
	<li>Every race should have at least one proficiency bonus, but no more than 2.</li>
	<li>Ideally, the player should have some choices regarding either subraces, attributes, or proficiencies.
	</li>
	<li>Be careful making races that give +2 bonuses to both strength and dexterity, or both intelligence and will. Such
		races would make very strong warriors or wizards respectively with very little downside.
	</li>
</ol>
<h4><a id="C5S2"></a>Classes</h4>
<p>For a given character, their combat class answers the question <i>how do I fight? </i>and also suggests their
	background or origin story. For example, the barbarian fights with reckless melee attacks, showing little regard for
	personal safety or technique. Accordingly, a barbarian would be more likely to hail from a remote farming village or
	an uncivilized tribe than from a royal court or a monastery.</p>
<p>There is some ongoing debate as to the ideal number of classes in a TTRPG system. Too few classes, and players are
	less likely to find one that really captures their interest and vision. Too many, and the player is at risk of being
	drowned by excess choices, which may not be well balanced, either. I’ve decided to use 20 classes, which are grouped
	into five categories. Players who find the 20 classes intimidating can thus choose between one of these five
	categories, and then between the four classes within that category. Hopefully it is easier to make two simple
	choices than one complicated choice.</p>
<p>Here are the five categories:</p>
<table>
	<tr>

</table>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Starting bonuses for each class category are in addition to the starting bonus for
	each class.</p>
<p>In addition to each category’s attribute and proficiency bonus, each class category has a special bonus move they can
	make shared between all characters in that category. Here’s what each ability does:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Heavy Attack</b>: When making a weapon attack with your main hand, you may expend 1 AP to roll the damage
		die twice, taking the higher result.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Mana Regeneration</b>: When starting a combat turn with less than one AP, gain an ability point.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><b>Vital Strike</b>: When making a regular weapon attack, you may expend 1 ability point to lower the
		critical threshold by 2. (i.e. from 20 to 18, under normal circumstances.) </p></li>
	<li><p><b>Beast Speech</b>: You may spend 1 AP to gain the ability to converse with beasts. This ability lasts for
		one hour.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Meditation</b>: Once per long rest and while outside of combat, you may spend 1 AP to meditate or pray to
		your deity. You may increase 1 attribute of your choice by 1 for one hour, not exceeding the hard cap. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>A detailed explanation of classes is given below, in alphabetical order.</p>
<h5><a id="C5S2_Assassin"></a>Assassin</h5>
<p>An assassin’s art is a quick and sure death, delivered without remorse or hesitation. Typically employed by a
	political state or criminal syndicate, assassins quickly learn to make use of any weapon available, including the
	weapons of their own targets. This makes them extremely versatile adventurers, able to adapt to nearly any combat
	situation as the need arises. </p>
<p>While writing the backstory for an assassin, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Who has hired you in the past?</p></li>
	<li><p>How many targets have you killed? </p></li>
	<li><p>Do you remember your first kill?</p></li>
	<li><p>How did you acquire your unique skillset? </p></li>
	<li><p>Does your character struggle with any form of guilt?</p></li>
	<li><p>What made you give up your previous life and start adventuring?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Non-Good</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Assassination.</i>More than just a lucky shot, a successful assassination is the result of
	careful planning. You may expend 3 willpower to convert a critical hit into an assassination, damaging an enemy by
	30, or one-third their maximum health bar, whichever is higher. When triggered, assassination replaces your normal
	weapon damage.</p>
<p><b>Leveling Bonuses</b>:</p>
<p>At level 1, you gain +2 dexterity and proficiency in accuracy.</p>
<p>At level 2, learn <i>Hideaway.</i>Wherever you travel, you know the location of at least one secret hideout, lair,
	NPC, or dead drop location. Whenever the party takes a long rest, you may choose to visit this location instead of
	receiving the benefits of a long rest. When hideaway is activated, you may receive an assassination contract. The
	contract names an NPC and a bounty of at least 100 gold to be paid upon the contract’s completion. If the NPC
	perishes in any way while you have the contract, you receive the specified sum the following morning. You do not
	have to visit the hideaway, and the bounty is paid in full even if they did not perish as a result of your actions
	or you were witnessed during the commission of the crime. You may not have more than one assassination contract at a
	time, but you may cancel an active contract in order to receive a new one, at the DM’s discretion. You may not visit
	your hideaway if you are imprisoned, within a dungeon, or sufficiently deep in the wilderness.</p>
<p>If at any point you disclose the location of the hideaway (whether intentional or not), someone dispatches 1d4
	assassins to terminate you, who attack your party during a night’s rest. If this happens, you cannot use the
	hideaway ability again for 1d10 long rests.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: If the party spends multiple nights in or near a town, it is plausible that the
	Assassin character would be able to gain the benefits of a full rest on one night, while visiting their secret
	location on another night.</p>
<p>At level 3, you may choose to further specialize as either a Ninja or a Saboteur:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">As a Ninja, you gain advantage on stealth checks, and on attack rolls with thrown
	weapons.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">As a Saboteur, you gain a toolbelt of 3 grenades whenever you visit your hideaway. Each
	grenade deals 4d4 explosion damage to all targets in a ten foot radius. Targets up to twenty feet take half damage.
	You may not possess more than 3 grenades at a time.</p>
<p>At level 4, learn <i>Assassination: Descending Blade</i>. You may trigger an assassination when leaping down onto
	your target from a height of ten or more feet, even if you were not already concealed.</p>
<p>At level 5, your proficiency in stealth and accuracy increase to expertise.</p>
<p>At level 6, the critical threshold for your melee attacks is lowered by 1. Assassination minimum damage is increased
	by 10.</p>
<p>At level 7, as a Ninja: learn <i>Assassination: Deadly Toxin</i>. You learn a codename that connects you to a
	supplier of deadly poison. When hideaway is activated, you may spend 500 gold to purchase a vial of deadly toxin
	from this supplier. You may purchase only one vial of this poison at a time. With a bonus action, you (or another
	party member, with an action) may coat their blade with the toxin, converting their next melee weapon strike into an
	assassination. If you forget the name of the supplier, you lose this ability. You may attempt to re-learn the
	codename by inquiring at the hideaway, at the discretion of them DM. If at any point you disclose the name of the
	supplier (whether intentional or not), the supplier dispatches 1d4 assassins to terminate you, who attack your party
	during a night’s rest.</p>
<p>Note: If the hideaway location is a dead drop, you cannot purchase the toxin immediately. Instead, you leave behind a
	special mark or indication, along with the payment. The poison will be in your pack by the time you return to
	camp.</p>
<p>At level 7, as a Saboteur: learn <i>Nail Bomb</i>. You learn a codename that connects you to an arms manufacturer.
	When hideaway is activated, you may spend 500 gold to purchase a bomb that deals 6d6 + 12 piercing damage to all
	targets within 20 feet. The bomb is armed or disarmed by inserting a special key, and can be configured to explode
	on touch, after a delay, or by a proximity spell. If disassembly is attempted, the bomb explodes, even if it was not
	armed.</p>
<p>At level 8, gain <i>Assassination: Vital Strike</i>. When vital strike triggers a critical, it now triggers an
	assassination, if possible.</p>
<p>At level 10, learn <i>Redirection</i>. If an enemy melee attack against you fails, you may roll for Martial Arts to
	redirect that damage into an enemy adjacent to your attacker.</p>
<p>At level 12, the critical threshold for your attacks is lowered by 1. Assassination minimum damage is increased by
	10.</p>
<p>At level 15, learn <i>Assassination: Sniper Shot</i>. You may trigger an assassination by striking your target with a
	critical hit from a ranged weapon from a concealed position. </p>
<p>At level 18, learn <i>Double Assassination</i>. When triggering Assassination: Stealth or Assassination: Descending
	Blade near at least two enemy targets, you may trigger Assassination on two targets instead of one. </p>
<h5><a id="C5S2_Barbarian"></a>Barbarian</h5>
<p>Whether a local farmhand or a tribesman from a remote tundra or jungle, barbarians are united by their unparalleled
	fury in battle, as well as sheer physical brawn. By tapping into primal rage, barbarians can strike harder and
	faster than anyone else while laughing off blows that would stagger an ordinary man. Barbarians typically wear light
	armor, and swing the largest weapons they can find. Their bodies are often covered in scars, either from tribal
	initiation rituals, or past battles. Some barbarians channel their rage in a drunken stupor, while others transform
	into the animals that embody their inner beast.</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for an assassin, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Have you always been strong, or did you go through a lot of training?</p></li>
	<li><p>Is your immense brawn shared by other members of your family or tribe?</p></li>
	<li><p>When did you first discover that rage could make you stronger?</p></li>
	<li><p>What made you give up your previous life and start adventuring?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Chaotic</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: Rage. You may spend 6 ability points to enter a rage for 5 combat turns. During a rage, you deal
	3 extra damage per weapon attack and take 3 less damage from bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, and fire damage.You
	may not cast spells, read scrolls, or consume potions.</p>
<p><b>Limitations</b>: Barbarians choose a deficiency in two of the following three skills: defense, literacy, stealth.
</p>
<p><b>Leveling Bonuses</b>:</p>
<p>At level 1: +2 to Strength, proficiency in intimidation and survival.</p>
<p>At level 2: When you enter your rage, you deliver a terrifying roar. Nearby</p>
<p>At level 3: You may choose to further develop your rage, as a Berserker or Skald.</p>
<p>As a Berserker, you gain the ability to intensify your rage. Once per turn, you may expend two AP to increase your
	damage by 2 and damage reduction by 1, for the remainder of your current rage.</p>
<p>As a Skald, you </p>
<p>At level 4, you </p>
<p>Berserker:</p>
<p>At level 3, controlled rage</p>
<p>level 4 skullcrushing finisher: end rage early and deal extra damage. If deathblow, rage does not end.</p>
<p>level 6 bloodlust: rage deepens from incoming damage</p>
<p>level 10 blackout rage</p>
<h5><a id="C5S2_Crusader"></a>Crusader</h5>
<p>The crusader offers their services to a chosen deity by taking a formal theological oath. As long as the oath is
	kept, their powers never wane and their enemies are smitten down before them. But even the most devoted mortal may
	at times be sorely tempted to break their oath. Should the temptation prove too much, the crusader may find
	themselves tumbling down a new path altogether, of the oathbreaker.</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for a crusader, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Which god do you serve, and why?</p></li>
	<li><p>What made you give up your previous life and start adventuring?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Lawful</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Righteous Oath</i>. You have sworn a solemn oath to a higher power, whose goals </p>
<p>Leveling Bonuses:</p>
<p>At level 1, you gain +2 willpower, and proficiency in either medicine or intimidation.</p>
<h5><a id="C5S2_Druid"></a>Druid</h5>
<p>Whether a shaman from a remote tribe or an isolated hermit, a druid reveres, worships, and protects nature. Nature
	rewards this special connection by allowing the druid to practice unique and powerful forms of magic, such as
	transforming into various animals.</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for a druid, consider the following:</p>
<p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Non-evil</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Wildshape</i>. You have the ability to transform into animals, expending an amount of AP
	dependent on the animal chosen to do so.</p>
<p><b>Leveling Bonuses</b>:</p>
<p>At level 1, you gain the ability to transform into any tiny animal.</p>
<p>Tiny: mouse, spider, fish, frog, bird</p>
<p>Small: Puma, Wolf, Monkey</p>
<p>Medium: Alligator, Chimpanzee, Direwolf, Horse</p>
<h5><a id="C5S2_Inquisitor"></a>Inquisitor</h5>
<p>Often clad in black armor and concealed beneath a dark hood or mask, the inquisitor’s dark countenance usually
	conceals and ever darker heart. An inquisitor has been called by their deity to drive out heresy, and will not
	hesitate to interrogate or kill anyone who stands in his or her way. Inquisitors are perhaps best known for branding
	their opponents as heretics, marking them for divine retribution.</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for an inquisitor, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>How did you come to choose to serve your god?</p></li>
	<li><p>Is your persecution of heretics commanded by god directly, or through a religious institution?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Non-good</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Heretic’s Brand</i>. In addition to your regular equipment, you have a special branding iron
	obtained from your chosen deity. This iron is imbued with divine magic and cannot be heated by ordinary means, but
	you may expend 2 AP to whisper a short prayer or sacred word, causing the end of the brand to glow blazing hot. The
	brand retains its heat for 1 minute. It behaves as a short melee weapon and deals 1d6 plus your charisma modifier in
	fire damage. Enemies struck by this weapon also receive the heretic’s brand, marking them for divine retribution.
</p>
<p>Leveling Bonuses:</p>
<h5><a id="C5S2_Knight"></a>Knight</h5>
<p>The knight is a low-ranking noble with formal combat training. Although they may be called to fight in battle, a
	knight’s primary purpose is to serve for the glory of their Lord or Lady, to whom they have sworn an oath of fealty.
	Many knights are also accompanied by a squire, a young knight in training who may carry their lord’s banner or help
	them don and doff their armor. </p>
<p>On the battlefield, a knight is a magnificent sight, clad in expensive steel plate armor and with their lord’s
	enisgnia emblazoned on their shield. However, some knights forgo a shield altogether, preferring a heavier
	two-handed weapon. Either way, knights train extensively and are rarely caught flat-footed, even when out of
	armor.</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for a knight, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>How far back can you trace your lineage? </p></li>
	<li><p>Are you proud of your country, your liege, and your god?</p></li>
	<li><p>Was your oath of fealty inspired by love, respect, or political convenience?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Lawful</p>
<p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Oath of Fealty</i>. You have sworn an oath to a nobleman or noblewoman, to protect them with
	your life and to fight for them in battle. In return, they have provided you with armor and an excellent sword, in
</p>
<p><b>Leveling Bonuses</b>:</p>
<p>At level 2, your liege dispatches you on a quest, usually to rid the world of some evil or slay some troublesome
	beast. Although it is understood that you undertake this quest in order to honor your word, a sizeable payment would
	not be out of the question, paid upon completion.</p>

<p>A warg is usually a hermit or cultist who—over many years—has cultivated the ability to transform at will into a

<h5><a id="C5S2_Warlock"></a>Warlock</h5>
<p>Warlocks are a diverse sort, hailing from many walks of life. You may find one in a palace in the very heart of
	luxury, another in a dingy cave or a squalid coven, and a third in a quaint shack amidst a great forest. Wherever
	they are found, warlocks are defined by their immense power, gained from their pact with a supernatural entity. The
	terms of these pacts are as diverse and as varied as warlocks themselves, and bring danger, madness, and power in
	equal measure.</p>
<p>A warlock is an entity who has entered into a pact with an immaterial being, offering service in return for a
	fraction of the supplicated entity’s power. Broadly speaking, such pacts are usually made with demonic or fey
	beings, for angels and dragons have little use of pacts.</p>
<p>demonic patrons typically allow their supplicants to dispose of their power in whatever manner they wish, in exchange
	for enslavement in the afterlife. Conversely, fey entities constantly demand small favors or acts of service, but
	care very little for their supplicant’s eternal fate.</p>
<p>While writing the backstory for a warlock, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Why did you seek power in service to a supernatural being?</p></li>
	<li><p>Do you believe that this deal will turn out in your favor?</p></li>

<p>At level 1, gain +2 charisma and proficiency in perception. Once per day, you may perform a ritual of supplication to
	receive your warlock powers.</p>
<p>At level 2, in response to your supplications, a supernatural entity invades your mind during a dreamless sleep and
	takes you to a location in the astral plane. Roll a d6 to determine which pact is offered:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">1. Dark Pact: Scholar of the Abyss</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">You are taken to the ruins of a temple, perched precariously at the edge of the abyss. A
	black cloaked figure brings you to the edge of a dark pool, and bids you to immerse yourself in the waters therein.
	Once fully submerged, an eldritch horror beyond human comprehension enters your head through your eyes and nasal
	passages, bringing you visions of deep and forbidden knowledge. The entity fills your skull with whispers of
	infinite knowledge, a taste of what shall be yours if you swear your life to its service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 75px;">A dark tome with gilded pages. Opening the book transports your mind to an astral library
	of esoteric and arcane knowledge. Once per level, including this level, you may use this tome to acquire learned
	knowledge of any spell for which you meet the requirements. If anyone else attempts to use this tome, they must
	succeed a threshold 12 willpower check, or become mad for 1d4 days. The tome then crumbles to ash in their hands,
	and is returned to your possession the next time the clock strikes midnight.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">2. Dark Pact: Profane Champion</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">You slowly come to awareness, surrounded by a stinking and suffocating darkness. You hear
	the noise of buzzing flies, and see—or seem to see—the form of a wretched man, sewn inside a bodybag and swaying
	from the end of a noose. There is a sudden bolt of lightning and the bodybag splits open, exposing a gleaming silver
	blade among its visceral contents. As your hand grips the hilt, a sneering voice from within beseeches you to use
	the blade in service to True Death.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 75px;">A gleaming silver weapon which has an unnatural tendency to strike true. The weapon may
	take the form of a short weapon, medium weapon, or great weapon. The weapon’s hit chance increases with your
	charisma modifier. Each successful hit with this weapon during combat increases the damage of your next eldritch
	blast invocation by 1.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">3. Dark Pact: Infernal Tyrant</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">You are brought before the flaming throne of a demonic tyrant, with eyes of burning
	darkness. The entity does not speak to you, but a snap of his fingers directs a malnourished slave to present you
	with a flaming parchment scrawled in blood. The meaning of the worlds are burned into your mind: a slave for a
	slave. If you accept, you may choose one of the tyrant’s slaves to serve you in life. In return, you shall become
	the tyrant’s slave after your death—for eternity? </p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 75px;">An infernal servant, bound to your will. You may banish the servant back to their master’s
	realm at will, and summon them again once per long rest. The servant fights and levels as you do, and may be any
	race or gender of your choosing. However, they take a -3 penalty to all attributes, soft and hard caps, and their
	health and willpower are reduced by one half. They may choose a class category, but not a class, and are leveled to
	your current level.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">4. Fey Pact: Crystal Pixie</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">You find yourself reduced to miniscule size, peering out of the hollow of a tree. At
	first,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><br/><br/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">5. Fey Pact: Storm Djinn</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The entity takes you to a great palace in the clouds, everywhere bedecked with signs of
	unparalleled splendor: gates and trimmings of pure gold, gleaming pillars of marble, and tapestries of silk and
	satin. You are lead up a stair in a great minaret, past great windows at increasingly dizzying heights. At the top,
	a mighty Djinn </p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"><br/><br/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">6. Fey Pact: Celestial of the Great Comet</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Your you find yourself in the vast darkness of outer space. Stars swirl around you and
	dance across your body, sparkling with splendor. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">If you accept, you receive:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 75px;"><br/><br/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><br/><br/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><br/><br/></p>
<p>You may accept this pact and all boons it confers, or reject it. If rejected, another pact will be offered on a
	subsequent night. If the DM allows, you do not need to roll a d6 again and may simply choose the pact you
	desire.</p>
<h5><a id="C5S2_Wizard"></a>Wizard</h5>
<p>Cloistered in his high tower, a tall and heavily bearded man pushes arcane magic to its absolute limit. Bedecked in a

	electricity arcs from the tips of his fingers.</p>
<p>No-one knows how he got his power; some say it runs in his blood, while others say that he was expelled from a

<h4>Alignment</h4>
<p>In keeping with traditional TTPRGs, we use a simple alignment system to roughly track a character’s motives. The
	alignment chart has two axes: <i>lawfulness </i>and <i>morality</i>. Lawfulness describes a character’s
	predictability and their faith (or lack of faith) in ideals. Meanwhile, morality describes a character’s level of
	empathy and compassion for others, or lack thereof.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Lawful Good</td>
		<td>Neutral Good</td>
		<td>Chaotic Good</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lawful Neutral</td>
		<td>True Neutral</td>
		<td>Chaotic Neutral</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lawful Evil</td>
		<td>Neutral Evil</td>
		<td>Chaotic Evil</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The Alignments</p>
<p>A character’s alignment provides a rough guide to how they intend to behave. Of course, a character’s alignment can
	change over time, and not all actions are perfectly representative of their alignment. Also, certain actions don’t
	have a middle ground. You either run into a burning orphanage to save the children, or you don’t. Such circumstances
	can be polarizing, driving character development and pushing neutral characters towards the extremes of morality.
	Likewise, polarizing events might also serve to disillusion good characters and turn them evil or neutral, or
	inspire evil characters to reconsider their ways.</p>
<p>Before we move on, I’d like to dispel some misconceptions regarding lawfulness and the alignment chart in general.
	First, alignment should always be secondary to a character’s personality. Second, lawfulness is often used to
	capture two separate ideas. The first interpretation is <i>a tendency to follow laws </i>while the second is <i>a
		tendency to believe in and adhere to some fixed set of ideals</i>. This leads to confusion because a seemingly
	lawful paladin could suddenly start breaking laws if they travel to a land where the foreign laws conflict heavily
	with their ideals. It’s not always clear whether this represents a change in alignment or not. Although there’s no
	single correct interpretation, I suggest a third interpretation that lawful characters tend to behave according to
	reason and logic, while chaotic characters behave according to emotion. One advantage of this interpretation is that
	it allows lawful characters the flexibility to sometimes be driven by pure emotion, and also explains when and why
	chaotic characters behave unpredictably—as opposed to just providing chaos for the sake of chaos.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Effect: The player learns to use the flail, an unusual weapon designed to bypass shields.
	The player unlocks the <i>Flailing Strike</i>ability for the flail, reducing BC gained by opponents with shields.
	Specifically, the shield no longer provides any BC unless it is actively blocking, in which case BC provided is
	reduced by half.</p>
<p>Combat Training: Hook Sword</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Cost: 100 Gold and 4 training slots</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Effect: The player learns to use the hook sword, a rare sword designed to trip up or
	disarm opponents. When successfully parrying, the player may disarm the opponent bypassing a martial arts skill
	check. The DT of the skill check is equal to the opponent’s dexterity attribute.</p>
<p>Combat Training: Grappling Hook</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Cost: 100 Gold and 6 training slots</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Prerequisite: 15 dexterity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Effect: The player learns to use the grappling hook in combat, acquiring the ability <i>Come
	Hither</i>. Using an offhand action, the player may make throw the grappling hook at a target within 20 feet. Upon a
	successful accuracy skill check against the target’s dexterity, the target is pulled 15 feet towards the player.</p>
<p>Mobility Training: Grappling Hook</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Cost: 50 gold and 1 training slots</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Effect: The player learns to use the grappling hook to escape, acquiring the ability <i>Vertical
	Escape</i>. Using a main hand action, the player can throw the grappling hook to any point overhead in a 20 foot
	radius and climb using their movement points.</p>
<h4><a id="Appendix_Weapons"></a>Weapons</h4>
<p>Certain weapons have special properties, which affect how they behave:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Piercing</b>: The weapon deals piercing damage only.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Slashing</b>: The weapon deals slashing damage only.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Bludgeoning</b>: The weapon deals bludgeoning damage only.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Cut-and-Thrust</b>: The item can deal either piercing or slashing damage.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Parrying</b><span>:	The weapon allows parrying, increasing parry chance for the weapon	by the indicated amount.</span>
	</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Blocking</b><span>:	The weapon allows blocking, increasing BC by a certain amount, and	double when actively blocking.</span>
	</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Mordhau</b>: The weapon can be held in a reversed grip to change the damage type to bludgeoning. This
		changes the weapon’s damage die. (Larger swords have this property.) </p></li>
	<li><p><b>Versatile</b>: The weapon can be held in a two handed grip for extra damage.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Nimble</b>: Dexterity can be used to augment the weapon’s damage, instead of strength.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Improvised</b>: The item is not primarily intended as a weapon. The damage die is rolled with
		disadvantage. </p></li>
	<li><p><b>Light</b>: The weapon can be dual-wielded, alongside another light weapon. Of a ranged weapon, indicates
		that the weapon can be fire with one hand. (All small weapons have this property.)</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Heavy</b>: The weapon requires two hands to use effectively, and has a strength requirement. (All great
		weapons and polearms have this property.)</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Sharp</b>: The critical threshold for the weapon is reduced to the indicated amount. (Daggers and
		Stilettos have this property.)</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Reach</b>: The weapon can hit targets 10 feet away, instead of 5.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Throwable</b>: In addition to regular use, the weapon can be effectively thrown.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Thrown</b>: The weapon is <i>only</i>thrown, and never retained in the hand.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Projectile</b>: The weapon fires a specific type of projectile.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Loading</b>: Once discharged, the weapon must be loaded again to be re-used. Loading such a weapon takes a
		full main hand action. The weapon’s damage is also not affected by any attributes of the bearer, such as
		strength or dexterity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Small Weapons</p>
<p>Such weapons are those which are easily wielded in one hand, including small everyday tools improvised as weapons.
	Typically wielded by civilians, and easily concealed. These weapons automatically have the light property, and can
	be dual-wielded or used in an offhand. Most of these weapons use the d4 damage die, except the club and sickle.
	However, these possess the improvised trait. Therefore, the dagger and stiletto are usually the best choices from
	this category.</p>

<h4><a id="Appendix_Gear"></a>Armor</h4>
<p>Many forms of armor are available for the prospective adventurer. In general, nimble and dexterous characters such as
	thieves and assassins prefer leather armor or brigandine. Barbarians, mercenaries, inquisitors, and most others
	usually make use of medium armors, such as breastplate or chainmail. Knights, veterans, and crusaders often wear
	splinted mail or even full plate, being stouter folk.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Cheaper forms of chainmail struggle versus piercing damage, but high quality mail no
	longer has this weakness. However, those talented with the estoc sword may yet be able to pierce it.</p>
