<p>Combat is pure chaos. It's nothing like the movies; you won't find any choreographed fencing with somersaults and
	pirouettes, dramatic music, or witty banter. Real combat is full of noise and blood and grime, broken bones, and the
	screams of the dying—or the eerie silence of the dead. Be that as it may, mortal combat is actually the pinnacle of
	problem-solving on a great many worlds. So you'd better get good at it.
</p>
<p>In order to make sense out of chaos, combat is divided into <i>turns</i> and <i>rounds</i>. A turn of combat captures
	a single fighter doing their best to kill and not be killed for a single 5-second snapshot of time. Meanwhile, a
	round is completed when all combatants have completed their turn. Turns do not happen simultaneously, but in order
	of initiative, which will be explained shortly. Once combat has started, it continues through as many rounds as it
	needs to until only one faction remains, and all others have either surrendered, fled, or been slain. Then it ends,
	as quickly as it began.
</p>
<p>In addition to turns and rounds, we often use a grid to make sense out of the way monsters and playe</p>
<h4></h4>
<ol></ol>
<p>Combat begins with a skill check, as both players and npc combatants roll for initiative. In <i>All That Glitters</i>,
	rolling for initiative is an ordinary event roll, and therefore all other rules such as proficiency bonuses apply.
	When two characters roll the same initiative, players move before monsters, and two players rolling the same
	initiative may either reach an agreement about who moves first or roll a d20 to decide. Monsters rolling the same
	initiative move in whatever order the DM decides.
</p>
<p>Optionally, the DM may decide to allow players to roll for recognition to see the stats of the monsters they are
	about to fight. This check depends on the survival skill and its DT is determined by the rarity of the monsters in
	question:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Monster Rarity</th>
		<th>Interpretation</th>
		<th>Typical DT</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Common</td>
		<td>The monster's physicalities are thoroughly documented in literature, and its attacks are an (at least)
			annual occurance.
		</td>
		<td>18</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rare</td>
		<td>The monster has been seen before, but not studied thoroughly. It may have been years to decades since the
			last sighting.
		</td>
		<td>24</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Legendary</td>
		<td>The monster has not been sighted in perhaps a century or more. Many doubt that it still exists, or ever
			existed.
		</td>
		<td>30</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The recognition roll is normally made with disadvantage if the area is obscured by heavy fog or darkness. Conversely,
	players may roll with advantage if attempting to discern monsters that emit distinctive noises or smells. If
	successful, the players gain knowledge of the monster's HP, attacks, and mitigation stat, and any other information
	the DM chooses to reveal. If there are several monsters attacking together, the roll should be done in one go rather
	than rolling again for each unique type of monster in the encounter.
</p>
<p>After initiative and recognition are rolled, combatants begin to take turns in order of their initiative score.
	Combat then proceeds until the last monster has acted, completing the first round of combat. Subsequent rounds
	proceed in the same fashion, with characters and monsters taking turns attacking each other until only one faction
	remains, at which point combat ends.
</p>
<p style="margin-left=25px">Note: Sometimes, players may have a chance to view their enemies from a distance before they
	are recognized. In this case, they may roll for recognition before combat begins, usually with advantage.
</p>
<p>During an ambush or surprise attack, sometimes one side is so completely discombobulated that they are unable to
	defend themselves decisively. This condition is called <i>surprise</i> and has the following effects:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Characters cannot make recognition rolls</li>
	<li>Initiative rolls are made with disadvantage.</li>
	<li>Reactions are unavailable until after the first turn.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Each combat round corresponds roughly to 5 seconds of time in the game world.</p>
<h4><a id="Actions"></a>Actions</h4>
<p>At the beginning of every combat turn, players gain one main hand action, one offhand action, and movement points
	equal to one half their speed attribute. The various actions taken during the turn deplete these resources until the
	player has no more abilities to use, at which point their turn ends. Monsters may have more or fewer actions that
	human players, but otherwise their combat turns proceed in essentially the same way.
</p>
<p>In addition to these, combatants possess hit points and AP. Hit points are related to the strength stat, and the
	character or monster falls unconscious when they are reduced to zero. AP are related to the willpower stat, and are
	expended as the player or monster uses special abilities. When a character has zero AP, they are said to be
	exhausted, but there is not usually a penalty for this condition.
</p>

<h4><a id="Attacking"></a>Attacking</h4>
<p>The actions most commonly taken during a turn are those that deal damage. Attacks are handled in two parts, the first
	being an attack roll to determine whether the attack connects, and the second being a damage roll to determine how
	much damage is dealt. The attack roll is an ordinary skill check for either martial arts (for melee) or accuracy
	(for ranged). The DT of the attack roll is the mitigation stat of the target.
</p>
<p>To determine the damage of an attack which has connected, the player rolls that weapon’s damage dice and adds the
	ability score modifier to the total value. Each weapon has a unique damage die and one or more attack attributes.
	For example, a dagger’s damage die is a d4 and its attribute is dexterity. A player with a dexterity score of 12
	rolling a 4 on a 1d4 would deal a total of 6 damage—4 from the weapon die, and 2 from their dexterity ASM. To give
	another example, a pike has a damage die of d12 and either speed or strength may be used as its attribute. A
	character with 14 speed rolling an 8 on the d12 would deal a total of 12 damage with their pike.
</p>
<p>Attack rules for spells are different and depend on the precise spell in question. Many spells partially or
	completely bypass ordinary mitigation or hit an entire area at once. In such cases, the target usually tries to pass
	a skill check to avoid full damage, rather than the caster trying to pass an ability check to cast the spell.
</p>
<h4><a id="Moving"></a>Moving</h4>
<p>When moving around on a rectangular battle grid, the player expends 1 movement point for every vertical, horizontal,
	or diagonal move. Optionally, players can agree that diagonal movement costs 1.5 movement points. This effectively
	makes reachable tiles more circular and makes fractional movement points more relevant, but also increases the
	complexity of combat. In any case, a character cannot enter a tile unless they have the required amount of movement
	points remaining. For example, a character with 5.5 movement points would be able to move at most 5 tiles
	horizontally or vertically.
</p>
<p>In a 5-second combat round with 5-foot square tiles, a speed of 10 (average) translates to 5 feet per second, or
	around 3.5 miles per hours. This implies a typical jog speed of 7 miles per hour, and a sprint speed of 14 miles per
	hours.
</p>
<h4><a id="Grappling"></a>Grappling</h4>
<p>A player can attempt to grapple an enemy by using both a main and offhand action. If they are able to pass a martial
	arts check with a DT of enemy’s strength attribute, the grapple is successful. In this event, the grappled creature
	cannot move or take main or offhand actions during their turn. However, they can roll a martial arts check with a DT
	equal to the player’s strength attribute. If they succeed, they are no longer grappled and will be able to move and
	act normally on their next turn.
</p>
<p>Note that relative size affects grappling chances. If a player attempts to grapple a smaller enemy, they gain
	advantage on the martial arts check, while if they attempt to grapple a larger enemy, they gain disadvantage. No
	character may grapple a character more than one size class larger than they are.
</p>
<p>If a player is grappling an enemy at the start of their turn, they may drag, throw, or release the enemy. While
	dragging, the player moves at half speed and cannot take any other actions. The player can attempt to throw the
	enemy by making a strength check, with the
</p>
<p>Finally, a player can choose to release a grappled enemy. This does not cost a main or offhand action, but the player
	will have to pass another martial arts check to grapple the creature again. Players have advantage on attacks
	against creatures they have just released from being grappled.
</p>
<h4><a id="Reacting"></a>Reacting</h4>
<p>Reactions are special moves that happen in response to specific triggers, such as an enemy moving into or out of
	melee range. Reactions take effect before a player’s next turn, and give the player the option to expend actions for
	their pending turn to make special moves. Each player may take only one reaction per turn, and using a reaction
	expends some of the actions that would normally be available on their next turn.
</p>
<p>For example, if a player is engaged in melee combat with a monster that chooses to run away, the player can make a
	special move called an opportunity attack to punish the monster for turning its back on an attacker. This allows the
	player to deal the damage of an full attack while only expending an offhand action. However, on their next turn they
	will only have a main hand action, since their offhand action was used to damage the escaping monster. If that
	player decides to consume a potion on their next turn, they would have to expend a main hand action to do so,
	instead of the usual offhand action.
</p>
<p>Most monsters are also capable of scoring opportunity attacks against players, but players can use the disengage
	action to avoid this. Disengage allows the player to move out of melee range without triggering the opportunity
	attack reaction, useful for repositioning.
</p>
<h4><a id="Defeat"></a>Defeat</h4>
<p>When a monster or player character loses all their hitpoints, they can no longer fight and fall unconscious. What
	happens to a player character at this point depends on whether you are playing according to permadeath or modern
	rules.
</p>
<p>Under permadeath rules, once the player has been downed they roll a d20 every time it is their turn in combat. Every
	roll of a 10 or higher is considered a save, while every roll of 9 or lower is considered a fail. If the character
	makes three saves, they become stable and do not need to make additional saves to stay alive. However, if a
	character accumulates three fails, they are dead and can only be revived by powerful resurrection magic. Under this
	system, players can be revived and resume fighting after being healed by any healing spell, as long as they have not
	actually died.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Under permadeath rules, rolling a natural 20 immediately causes the player to become
	stable.
</p>
<p>The modern rules offer an alternative system where unconscious players do not need to make saving throws to stay
	alive. However, they also do not regain consciousness after being healed by healing magic. Instead, they regain
	consciousness 1d4 hours after combat is over.
</p>
<p>In gameplay strategy, modern rules prioritize keeping the characters conscious, making single-target healing spells
	quite valuable. Permadeath rules favor mass healing spells that resurrect the character whenever they fall. You
	should think carefully about which system works best for you.
</p><a id="Damage_Types"></a>
<h4>Damage Types</h4>
<p>Smashing, slashing, poisoning, burning… There are quite a few ways to do someone in. Here's a list of damage types
	and their unique effects:
</p>
<p>Common damage types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Slashing</b>: Liable to cause bleeding.</li>
	<li><b>Bludgeoning</b>: +3 to hit versus plate armors.</li>
	<li><b>Piercing</b>: +3 to hit versus mail armors.</li>
	<li><b>Fire</b>: Liable to cause burning.</li>
	<li><b>Freezing</b>: Reduces target dexterity.</li>
	<li><b>Lightning</b>: +3 to hit vs metal armor.</li>
	<li><b>Force</b>: Liable to knock the target prone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rare damage types:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Acid/Corrosive</b>: Causes armor damage which must later be repaired at a smithy.</li>
	<li><b>Light/Holy</b>: Causes extra damage to undead and evil aligned creatures.</li>
	<li><b>Dark/Profane</b>: Causes extra damage to good-aligned creatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good-aligned characters possess resistance to holy damage, and evil-aligned characters possess resistance to profane
	damage.
</p>
<p>Explosions usually deal a mix of damage types, usually bludgeoning and a magical damage types.</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px">Note: poison is not a damage type. Poison attacks deal unique effects depending on their
	type. Those that damage the victim over time inflict acid damage (but do not damage armor).
</p>
<p>
	Poison effects: Neurotoxic -> Reduce willpower Hallucinogenic -> confusion or frenzy Paralytic -> Paralysis
	Blindness Amnesia Onset?
</p>
<h4><a id="Status_Effects"></a>Status Effects</h4>
<p>During combat, sometimes characters fall prey to certain temporary conditions that reduce their effectiveness in
	combat.
