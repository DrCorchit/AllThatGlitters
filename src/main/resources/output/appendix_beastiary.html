<h4>The Planes of Existence</h4>
<p>Broadly speaking, the world consists of physical, astral, infernal, and ethereal planes.</p>
<p>The physical planes are distinguished by strict natural laws and a magical veil which prevents creatures therein from
	obtaining more than a glimpse of the subtle mysteries of nature. Spirits within any of the physical planes are
	called mortals, or lesser spirits.
</p>
<p>The astral planes are any of various planes which are "softer" and more responsive to conscious intent than the
	physical. The lower astral mirrors the physical world, and contains low vibrational entities such as lurkers,
	energivores, and egregores, low ranking demons which prey on sentient energy. Higher astral planes are dreamlike,
	vibrant, and surreal, and are occupied by higher beings such as fey, djinn, dragons, and angels.
</p>
<p>The infernal planes are hells, created by demons. Each hell is simultaneously a prison and a palace for its reigning
	archdemon, alongside various lesser devils and enslaved spirits. Hells are filled with oppressive and joyless
	energy, and tend to suffocate emotions such as hope and compassion the longer one spends there. Hells are virtually
	indistinguishable from the physical plane, but are actually extremely condensed astral planes that are resistant to
	change from conscious intent.
</p>
<p>The ethereal planes are timeless planes of pure thought. They are changeless and eternal, and cannot be fully entered
	by mortal spirits. Each ethereal plane is the highest and purest expression of the god which inhabits it. Little is
	known about these planes, except that they act as sources of archetypical energy such as pure flame, pure light, or
	various pure emotions.
</p>
<h4>The Spirits of the Universe</h4>
<p>In general, beings are divided into three classes: mortals, higher beings, and gods.</p>
<p>Mortals (<i>animus mortalis</i>) are inhabitants of the physical plane, and are expressed via a physical body.
	Mortals tend to increase in energy over time, eventually becoming higher beings after thousands or millions of
	years. On death, mortal spirits wander the lower astral until they either reincarnate or are summoned into the
	domain of a god or demon.
</p>
<p>
	Higher beings (<i>animus aethera</i>, or demigods) are inhabitants of the nonphysical (astral) planes. Roughly
	speaking, there are four types of higher beings: demons, dragons, fey (including djinn) and angels. These beings
	serve to create, preserve, and destroy aspects of the physical realm, according to their own whims or the will of
	their creator. They can enter the physical world at will, but must expend energy to manifest a physical body to do
	so. If the body is destroyed, they return to their home in the astral and recuperate until eventually enough energy
	is gained for them to return. This process usually takes around 30 days to a year.
</p>
<p>
	Gods (<i>animus celestis</i>) are eternal beings of infinite creative power. Their existence is beyond human
	concepts such as pain, fear, death, or ambition. They can communicate with mortals and demigods, usually through
	exceptionally pure spirits called angels, but can do so directly if they wish to do so.
</p>
<h4>Types of Entity</h4>
