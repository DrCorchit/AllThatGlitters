<h2>Chapter 4</h2><h3><a id="C4"></a>How does my character become stronger?</h3>
<p>In All That Glitters, there are three ways that characters increase their power level: leveling, training, and
	looting. The main difference between these systems is that leveling provides guaranteed and predictable bonuses,
	while looting provides more irregular and chaotic bonuses that players cannot foresee. The bonuses from leveling
	promote planning and ambition, while the bonuses from looting are unique to each adventure, and promote character
	identity. Contrasting these, training allows players to take control of their own destinies and acquire the
	abilities they deem most useful.</p>
<h4><a id="Leveling"></a>Leveling</h4>
<p>Each character’s skill as an adventurer is measured by their level, which typically begins at 1 and progresses up to
	20. Typically, all characters in a party level up together, usually after a huge battle or major obstacle is
	overcome as the DM recognizes the adventuring party’s increasing skill and renown. This is known as milestone
	leveling. When leveling, players gain two types of bonuses: attribute training and class features. </p>
<p>As a result of training, players may increase two of their attribute scores by one, if the increase does not put
	either attribute above the soft cap for that character. If the player wishes to increase an ability beyond the soft
	cap, they may only increase one attribute score.</p>
<p>As part of attribute training, players increase their maximum HP and AP according to their strength and willpower
	scores, according to the following chart:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Attribute Level</th>
		<th>HP or AP per level</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1-3</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4-5</td>
		<td>1+1d4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>6-7</td>
		<td>2+1d4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8-9</td>
		<td>2+1d6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>10-11</td>
		<td>3+1d6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>12-13</td>
		<td>3+1d8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>14-15</td>
		<td>4+1d8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>16-17</td>
		<td>4+1d10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>18-19</td>
		<td>5+1d10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>20+</td>
		<td>5+1d12</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>When rolling for max HP or AP, players should roll the middle. Meaning, roll three dice and take the middle result.
	This reduces the occurrence of extreme values, which can be frustrating at low levels.</p>
<p>In addition to the attribute, HP, and AP bonuses, players gain unique bonuses (called class features) based upon
	their chosen combat class. These bonuses are covered <a href="c2.html#Choosing_a_Class">here</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="Training_and_Training_Slots"></a>Training and Training Slots</h4>
<p>It is possible for characters to proactively learn many abilities from NPC trainers, such as skill proficiencies,
	combat tactics, and spells. In addition to any gold cost, learning abilities in this way costs training slots. Each
	player has training slots equal to their intelligence score, which represent the time and mental effort required to
	fully master the new skill. Most abilities consume four training slots at first, but that number is reduced by half
	every time the player levels up, rounded down. After leveling up, any trained abilities that consume only one
	training slot become rote abilities, and no longer consume training slots. </p>
<p>If a player does not have enough training slots available to learn a new ability, they cannot learn the ability even
	if they have sufficient gold to purchase the training. In this case, players can choose to forget abilities they are
	in the process of learning. If this is done, the training slots for the forgotten ability are recovered but the gold
	use to purchase the ability is lost and the skill can no longer be used.</p>
<p>In order to learn new abilities, players must first ensure that they meet the requirements of the ability they are
	trying to learn. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Many abilities require a certain level of strength or intelligence, or other attribute.</p></li>
	<li><p>Some abilities require a level of proficiency in a certain skill.</p></li>
	<li><p>High level spells often require mastery of other low level spells before they can be learned.</p></li>
	<li><p>Players must have sufficient training slots available for the ability they are trying to learn.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming they meet these requirements, players must find and hire a trainer of the appropriate discipline and skill
	level. After this, the new ability is gained, and can be used at any point in the adventure.</p>
<h4><a id="Looting"></a>Looting</h4>
<p>Looting refers to the acquisition of gold, weapons, armor, and magical items during the adventure. Importantly,
	looting—and in particular, the acquisition of gold—is considered a part of the leveling process itself rather than a
	mere footnote. Because gold is so closely connected with training, DMs usually provide players a certain amount of
	gold per level, as indicated in the following chart:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Party Level</th>
		<th>Gold per player</th>
		<th>Typical Expenditures</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0-50</td>
		<td>The party is focused on basic spell and ability training</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2-3</td>
		<td>50-100</td>
		<td>The party continues to train spells and abilities, while beginning to explore enchanted gadgets and
			consumables
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4-5</td>
		<td>100-200</td>
		<td>The party begins upgrading weapons and armor.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>6-7</td>
		<td>200-300</td>
		<td>As players reach the soft caps for their attributes, elite attribute training becomes useful.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8-10</td>
		<td>300-500</td>
		<td>The party begins to venture beyond steel armor and weaponry to titanium and beyond.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>11-15</td>
		<td>500-1000</td>
		<td>Players pursue attribute training: Olympian.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>16+</td>
		<td>1000+</td>
		<td>The party focuses primarily on the acquisition of rare and powerful trinkets and armor.</td>
	</tr>
