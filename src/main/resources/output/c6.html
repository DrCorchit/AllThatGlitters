<p>Although much of the action outside of combat is fairly open-ended, there are specific rules for certain actions:</p>

	<li><a href="#Swimming">Swimming</a></li>

</ol>
<h4><a id="Resting"></a>Resting</h4>
<p>Over time, your characters become ragged and weary as they take damage and expend AP during combat. Although some HP
	and AP can be recovered with potions or abilities, most recovery is done through resting. There are two kinds of
	rests: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Long Rest</b>: The entire party makes camp and sleeps for 8 hours, completing the adventuring day. If in the
		wilderness, this typically involves setting up camp, building a fire, cooking dinner, and so forth. All HP and
		AP are fully restored. It's not possible to long rest inside certain areas, such as a fortress controlled by the
		enemy, or a hostile wilderness or dungeon.
	</li>
	<li><b>Short Rest</b>: The party sits down for an hour or so to dress their wounds and catch their breath. Each
		player recovers the same amount of HP and AP as they would gain upon leveling up. The party can short rest at
		most twice between long rests.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Travel"></a>Traveling</h4>
<p>When traveling long distance overland, there are a number of concerns: food, water, bandits, weather, and road
	quality. Of these, food and bandits are the most troublesome.
</p>
<h4><a id="Swimming"></a>Swimming</h4>
<p>In the water, movement speed is reduced by one half. So, a character with a speed score of 10 that normally moves at
	5 ft/s would swim at 2.5 ft/s. It's possible to train swimming speed (Athletics Training: Freestyle), to bring
	swimming nearly up to walking speed.</p>
<p>Underwater, players can normally hold their breath for 6 seconds per point invested in the strength attribute. As
	with swimming speed, this can be improved with training (Athletics Training: Diving).</p>
<h4><a id="Sneaking"></a>Sneaking</h4>
<p>Sneaking is handled as an ability check. The player that is attempting to sneak rolls for stealth. The DT is normally
	equal to the </p>
<h4><a id="Pickpocket"></a>Pickpocket</h4>
<h4><a id="Lockpicking"></a>Lockpicking</h4>
<h4><a id="Haggling"></a>Haggling</h4>
<p>Players can attempt to haggle merchants using the persuasion skill. A merchant can be haggled up to three times,
	offering successively larger discounts if the player is able to pass successively higher DT persuasion checks. If
	the player fails any haggle, the merchant becomes obstinate and the discount for that item cannot be increased
	further. If the player fails to surpass DT 10 on any haggle, the merchant becomes irritated and removes all
	discounts completely.</p>
<p>After attempting to haggle a merchant, the same merchant will not allow themselves to be haggled again for some time,
	unless they are fond of the adventuring party or from a culture where haggling is expected. The DM may impose
	situational bonuses or penalties to haggling accordingly.</p>
