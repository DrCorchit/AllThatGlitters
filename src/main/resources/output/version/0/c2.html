  <p>Now that you know the basics, you're ready to create a character. This section of the text will refer to some mechanics which aren't explained until the next chapter. If that bothers you, you can skip ahead and revisit this section later. However, you don't need to perfectly understand the rules to make an excellent character. I recommend at least a quick read of this chapter before moving on.</p>
  <p>Creating a character in <i>All That Glitters</i> is really simple. Just follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><a href="c2.html#races">Choose A Race</a></li>
   <li><a href="c2.html#classes">Choose a Class</a></li>
   <li><a href="c2.html#alignments">Pick an Alignment</a></li>

  </ol>
  <h4><a id="races"></a>Races</h4>
  <p>There are eight example races here, representing some favorite repeat offenders from the fantasy genre. That said, homebrewing new races is very much in the spirit of All that Glitters, and if a race you want to play isn’t in this list, you absolutely should create it. Alternatively, feel free to create your own lore for any of these races—don’t let my ideas stifle yours! Further on, I’ll explain some guidelines for creating new races while also respecting gameplay balance.</p>
  <h5>Human</h5>
  <p>Overall, humans are proud, robust, and athletic. I daresay we are altogether quite handsome. Men average around 5’9” in height; women around 5’4”. Weight varies greatly, usually between 100-200 lbs. We live between 70 and 90 years, if we do not die in one of our many wars.</p>
  <p>Although we humans may seem an uninspiring choice to some, it’s all a matter of perspective. To dwarves, we are tall and regal. To elves, we are robust and warlike. Among saurids, we are called slow and loud. And so it goes.</p>
  <p>Human characters begin with +1 to two attributes, and -1 to an attribute. They also begin with proficiency in a skill of their choice.</p>
  <h5>Elf</h5>
  <p>Graceful and elegant, elves often exemplify much of what humans aspire to be. In height, male elves average about 6’3”; female elves about 5’9”. Weight varies between 120-200 lbs. They are barely heavier than humans, despite their increased stature. The gods have truly blessed their race: they live around 200 years at least, and some (of the royal line) as long as five hundred.</p>
  <p>Over time, their kind has diverged into three bloodlines. Descendants of the royal bloodline are called Eldarii and excel in magic and all manner of letters. They incorporate magic into nearly every level of society. As a consequence, even their young children know basic spells. They are invariably blonde haired and fair skinned, and persistently arrogant. Some of them attempt to repent their hubris, but I have come to prefer the frank honesty of arrogance to a feigned humility.</p>
  <p>Members of the common line are called Numenarii, and pursue archery, hunting, fishing, and farming. They have interbred on occasion with humans, and so take on darker hair and skin tones. They imitate the arrogance of the Eldarii, though it is but a veneer: they are quite insecure.</p>
  <p>Members of the third bloodline are called Drow, and are descended from the line of the nameless usurper. Tales of their cruelty are exaggerated, but not by much. Their skin is bluish gray, and their hair silver. They do not spare themselves from their own ruthless designs, and many attempt to escape their subterranean holds. Those few who do often become brave adventurers.</p>
  <p>All elven characters suffer a -1 penalty to <b>STR</b>, and gain bonuses depending on their bloodline. Those of the royal line gain +2 <b>INT</b> and knowledge of a level 1 astrology or elemental spell, plus proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>literacy</u><span>Measures knowledge that would usually be obtained via formal education or reading books, such as philosophy, mathematics, economics, or history. Deficiency in this skill normally indicates that the character is illiterate.</span></a>. However, they also have deficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>survival</u><span>Measures general survival skills, including the ability to recognize threats, build shelter, and live off the land. Used when attempting to recognize monsters at the start of combat.</span></a>. Members of the common line gain +2 <b>DEX</b> and proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>nature</u><span>Measures background knowledge that would usually be obtained by spending time in nature or around animals. Used when casting nature spells.</span></a> and <a class="tooltip"><u>accuracy</u><span>Describes a player’s accuracy with ranged weapons such as bows and firearms.</span></a>, but suffer deficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>defense</u><span>Skill at defensive maneuvers and tactics, in particular armor and shields.</span></a>. Drow gain +2 <b>CHA</b> and proficiency in perception and <a class="tooltip"><u>stealth</u><span>Used when sneaking or attempting to perform actions without being seen. Speed cannot be used if the noise of sprinting would arouse excessive suspicion.</span></a>, at the cost of -1 to <b>NST</b> and deficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>nature</u><span>Measures background knowledge that would usually be obtained by spending time in nature or around animals. Used when casting nature spells.</span></a>. Drow also have the gift of darkvision, allowing them to see normally in dim light.</p>
  <h5>Dwarf</h5>
  <p>A short and ruddy race. Male dwarves average around 5 feet in height, while their females average around 4’8”. Despite their stature, they weigh between 100-160 lbs. It is customary for their men to grow long beards, though beards longer than twenty inches are seldom seen outside storybooks. They live a bit longer than humans, so a century and a half is not out of the question.</p>
  <p>The dwarves of yore possessed insatiable bloodthirst and fought man, elf, and dragon alike in a great many wars. Times have changed, and they have been at peace nigh on two millennia. They are now greatly concerned with the exploration of mountains and caves, the industry of mining, and the acquisition of gold.</p>
  <p>Despite their unusual habits and short stature, dwarves are actually a fairly well balanced race that can excel in many roles. Dwarves gain +1 <b>STR</b> and +1 <b>CHA</b> at the cost of -2 <b>SPD</b>, and choose an additional +1 in <b>STR</b> or <b>CHA</b>. Also, dwarves have a keen sense for gold and have advantage on <a class="tooltip"><u>perception</u><span>The ability to discern more than is immediately obvious. When attempting to perceive a character’s honesty or motives, charisma becomes the base stat.</span></a> and <a class="tooltip"><u>persuasion</u><span>Used when engaging in factual debate, intimidation, or deception. Strength becomes the base attribute only when making a threat of physical force.</span></a> checks when searching for treasure or bartering with merchants. All dwarves have proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>defense</u><span>Skill at defensive maneuvers and tactics, in particular armor and shields.</span></a>. Dwarves make particularly fearsome warriors, but are a solid choice in many other roles.</p>
  <h5>Halfling</h5>
  <p>The shortest of the races, halfling men average 3’9” in height. Their women are yet shorter, scarcely 3’6” by average. A tall halfling may resemble a short dwarf, though the former may still be distinguished by his slender build and wispy facial hair, if he has any at all. Halflings weigh only 50-100 lbs, and I’ll wager a drink you can’t find a heavier one in under a fortnight. They are somewhat long lived, often lasting a bit more than a century.</p>
  <p>As timeless as their quaint and cozy country villages may seem, they are no strangers to change. Nearly half of them are now second or third generation immigrants in large cities. They are unwelcome there on account of their ill reputation: it is said that nearly a third of them are criminals. I don't doubt it; they make exceedingly sly thieves.</p>
  <p>Halflings tend to be unbalanced characters, having a -2 penalty to <b>STR</b> and a -1 penalty to <b>SPD</b>. They make up for this with a +2 to DEX, and another +2 to <b>INT</b>, <b>CHA</b>, or <b>NST</b>. All halflings have proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>folklore</u><span>Measures knowledge gained from listening to locals and engaging in conversation with diverse sorts of individuals. In addition to local geography and history, includes knowledge of myths, mythical beings, and religion.</span></a>, but urban halflings have proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>mobility</u><span>The ability to climb, mantle, vault, and otherwise navigate past obstacles.</span></a> while rural halflings have proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>nature</u><span>Measures background knowledge that would usually be obtained by spending time in nature or around animals. Used when casting nature spells.</span></a>. They excel as mages, naturalists, or renegades, but struggle as warriors.</p>
  <h5>Orc</h5>
  <p>Stout and rippling with muscle, orcs are warriors to the last. Their menfolk are nearly as tall as the elves, around 6’, and their women are barely any shorter, around 5’10”. Fully grown, they weigh somewhere between 180 to 300 lbs—quite formidable! Their hair is almost invariably black or gray, while their skin ranges from dark green to pale yellow or gray. In years, they may reach 60 if they are lucky; usually less. They make up for this by living with what I will graciously call ‘extreme vigor’.</p>
  <p>The history of orcs is full of long and bloody intertribal conflicts. Despite this, they have made steady progress as a species and have transitioned from cave dwellings to small villages, then larger villages, until now many think to mingle with humans, dwarves, and halflings on the frontiers of civilization. (Elves will have none of their ilk.) They are well-suited to mercenary or guard work. They make poor thieves or wizards.</p>
  <p>Orcs gain +2 to <b>STR</b> and +1 to either <b>CHA</b> or <b>NST</b>, at the cost of -1 to <b>DEX</b> and -1 <b>INT</b>. They have proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>folklore</u><span>Measures knowledge gained from listening to locals and engaging in conversation with diverse sorts of individuals. In addition to local geography and history, includes knowledge of myths, mythical beings, and religion.</span></a> and <a class="tooltip"><u>survival</u><span>Measures general survival skills, including the ability to recognize threats, build shelter, and live off the land. Used when attempting to recognize monsters at the start of combat.</span></a>. Above all, they make excellent warriors.</p>
  <h5>Tiefling</h5>
  <p>Of middling stature and musculature, tieflings are nearly human. Yet as the saying goes, ‘so close and yet so far.’ By virtue of their debauched bloodline (the devil-dealings of their ancestors being no small secret) they are cursed with horns, pointed ears, and skin of a blood-red hue (or other outrageous colors). Almost everywhere, they are shunned by all ‘good’ folk. Yet I think they can be accorded a little understanding, for they are neither warlike nor pompous and wisely take their poor lot in life with a dose of good humor.</p>
  <p>It is difficult to give a straightforward account of their physical nature, because it is so widely varied. I have seen some as short as 5’ and others as tall as 6’8”. They are neither particularly bulky nor slender, and so their weight is comparable to that of a human. Only in longevity have the gods relented, granting them perhaps 110 years, around the same span as a halfling.</p>
  <p>Tieflings typically live in colonies suitably removed from human and elven settlements. They have dealings with dwarves and halflings, who treat them fairly. They quietly pursue industry and keep to themselves, but their young oft grow weary of their meek ways and seek adventure and companionship abroad.</p>
  <p>Tieflings gain +2 to <b>CHA</b> and +1 to another attribute, at the cost of -2 to another attribute. They possess the gift of darkvision, and can see in total darkness to a range of 3 yards, or dim light to about 30 yards. They have proficiency in two of <a class="tooltip"><u>performance</u><span>Captures a player's ability to sing, dance, play instruments, or otherwise entertain a crowd. Proficiency with this skill implies the ability to play at least one musical instrument.</span></a>, <a class="tooltip"><u>medicine</u><span>Measures knowledge of disease and wound treatment.</span></a> or <a class="tooltip"><u>perception</u><span>The ability to discern more than is immediately obvious. When attempting to perceive a character’s honesty or motives, charisma becomes the base stat.</span></a>.</p>
  <h5>Aarakocra</h5>
  <p>Flighty and covered with feathers, the Aarakocra are an extremely vibrant and colorful race. There are as many sub-races of these as of man or elf; it seems that many take after some species of bird or another. So you have one with feathers of azure and gold, another crimson, cream, and jade, and a third black as a raven. In general, they are about the size of a man, but extraordinarily light. I think 5'6" is a typical height, but they weigh less than 80 pounds. Their longevity varies greatly, and some have a span of up to 250 years, rivaling even the elves. However, this is not common and I have met very few over the age of ninety or so.</p>
  <p>On my travels, I have observed that Aarakocra races and tribes can be roughly divided into two categories: raptors and songbirds. The former are taller and stronger, and possess extremely keen hearing and sight. As for the songbirds, they are extremely quick with their limbs and can mimic almost any sound they hear. They have a reputation for bing tricksters, and are in the habit of gathering shiny things, as their brothers the ravens and crows do.</p>
  <p>Aarakocra gain a +2 bonus to <b>SPD</b>, but -1 to <b>STR</b>. All aarakocra can fly (when not wearing armor) and are immune to fall damage. Raptors gain +1 <b>STR</b> and proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>perception</u><span>The ability to discern more than is immediately obvious. When attempting to perceive a character’s honesty or motives, charisma becomes the base stat.</span></a>, while songbirds gain +1 <b>DEX</b> and proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>performance</u><span>Captures a player's ability to sing, dance, play instruments, or otherwise entertain a crowd. Proficiency with this skill implies the ability to play at least one musical instrument.</span></a>.</p>
  <h5>Saurid</h5>
  <p>Slinking, skulking, scurrying—these are words befitting a saurid. Treading the slender line between man and beast, they are a fierce folk. As much lizard as man, they possess scaly hides, long tails, and snouts lined with razor sharp teeth. Some say they are cruel, but having observed them closely on more than one occasion, I would rather describe them as practical.</p>
  <p>A saurid is typically shorter than a man, but they grow all their lives until old age. Some can become quite large. Their females are a bit taller and more muscular than their males. In terms of height, they reach about 5’6” while the male might reach only 5’2 or so. They are not long-lived, and seventy years is a ripe age for a saurid.</p>
  <p>The saurids I have seen are fairly xenophobic, and live in colonies inside caves usually near water. They hunt, fish, and raise their hatchlings quietly, having few dealings with man or elf, except for the occasional territorial clash. They have developed a unique sort of architecture, and their colonies are quite remarkable, often lavishly decorated with precious stones and cut stone. Their predilection for gathering all things shiny has attracted dwarven traders, which has brought the common tongue to their knowledge. Many of them now seek adventure abroad, bringing with them their fearsome and curious ways.</p>
  <p>Saurids gain +2 to <b>STR</b> and <b>SPD</b>, at the cost of -2 <b>INT</b> and -1 <b>CHA</b>. They possess the gift of darkvision, able to see in near total darkness. They have deficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>literacy</u><span>Measures knowledge that would usually be obtained via formal education or reading books, such as philosophy, mathematics, economics, or history. Deficiency in this skill normally indicates that the character is illiterate.</span></a> but may take proficiency in two out of <a class="tooltip"><u>folklore</u><span>Measures knowledge gained from listening to locals and engaging in conversation with diverse sorts of individuals. In addition to local geography and history, includes knowledge of myths, mythical beings, and religion.</span></a>, <a class="tooltip"><u>stealth</u><span>Used when sneaking or attempting to perform actions without being seen. Speed cannot be used if the noise of sprinting would arouse excessive suspicion.</span></a>, or <a class="tooltip"><u>survival</u><span>Measures general survival skills, including the ability to recognize threats, build shelter, and live off the land. Used when attempting to recognize monsters at the start of combat.</span></a>.</p>
  <h5>Custom Races</h5>
  <p>When creating new races, consider following these general guidelines:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>No stat bonus should exceed +2, and no stat penalty should exceed -2.</li>
   <li>The sum of all attribute bonuses minus all penalties should equal 1.</li>
   <li>Every race should have at least one proficiency bonus, but no more than 2.</li>
   <li>Ideally, the player should have some choices regarding either subraces, attributes, or proficiencies.</li>
   <li>Be careful making races that give +2 bonuses to both strength and dexterity, or both intelligence and will. Such races make very strong warriors or wizards respectively with very little downside.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5><a id="Size"></a>Size</h5>
  <p>A character's race also determines their size. Size is not recorded on the character sheet, but is usually medium. If you picked a halfling, it's small. Size primarily affects what weapons a character can and can’t use, terminal velocity, and how effectively they can grapple. Grappling will be explained in further detail in <a href="c5.html#Grappling">chapter 5</a>, while fall damage and terminal velocity will be explained in <a href="c6.html#Falling">chapter 6</a>.</p>

  <h4><a id="classes"></a>Classes</h4>
  <div class="row">
   <div class="column">
    <p>A character's combat class gives you an idea of both their fighting style and occupational background. Realtistically, these two are rarely separate. Unless you're an aristocrat, you don't have the time and money to aquire skills of little use within your day-to-day life. So a monk picks up his staff, a veteran takes his sword from the mantlepiece, or a scholar gathers her books. Each of them takes something familiar to them and does something extraordinary with it, as they begin their adventure.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to choose a class is to avoid all the details and just pick one that sounds cool. However, if you're of a mind to make an informed decision by carefully examine the unique features of each class, you certainly can. There are no wrong choices, only interesting ones.</p>
    <p>There is some ongoing debate as to the ideal number of classes in a TTRPG system. Too few classes, and players are less likely to find one that really captures their interest and vision. Too many, and the player is at risk of being drowned by excess choices—which may not be well balanced, either! I’ve decided to use 20 classes, which are grouped into five categories, listed below. Players who struggle to pick a class can thus choose between one of these five categories and then choose between one of the four classes within that category. Hopefully it is easier to make two simple choices than one complicated choice.</p>

  <p>In addition to each category’s attribute and proficiency bonus, each class category has a special bonus ability shared between all characters in that category. Here’s what each ability does:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Heavy Attack</b>: When making a strength-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 <a class="tooltip"><u>willpower</u><span>Expended when using powerful abilities.</span></a> to increase the damage of your attack. If it hits, you may roll your weapon's damage die a second time and add its value to the total damage for the attack.</li>
   <li><b>Mana Regeneration</b>: When starting a combat turn with less than two willpower, gain one willpower.</li>
   <li><b>Precision Strike</b>: When making a dexterity-based weapon attack, you may expend 2 AP to gain +3 to hit on the attack roll and lower the critical threshold by 1. (i.e. from 20 to 19, typically.)</li>
   <li><b>Beast Speech</b>: You know the language of beasts, and may converse with them at any time. Once a day, you may expend 5 AP to attempt a persuasion check to convince an animal to fight by your side for 1 hour. The difficulty of the check depends on the type of animal being recruited.</li>
   <li><b>Meditation</b>: Once per long rest and while outside of combat, you may expend 5 AP to meditate or pray to your deity. You may increase an attribute of your choice by 2 for one hour, not exceeding the hard cap.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to these bonuses, the proficiency bonus of the base skill for each category advances to the next level at level 5 and again at level 10. This bonus cannot increase the proficiency bonus beyond mastery.</p>
  <p>A detailed explanation of classes is given below, in alphabetical order.</p>
  <div class="background">
   <h5><a id="Assassin"></a>Assassin</h5>
   <p>An assassin’s art is a quick and sure death, delivered without remorse or hesitation. Typically employed by a political state or criminal syndicate, assassins quickly learn to make use of any weapon available, including the weapons of their own targets. This makes them extremely versatile adventurers, able to adapt to nearly any combat situation as the need arises.</p>
   <p>While writing the backstory for a assassin, consider the following:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Who has hired you in the past?</li>
    <li>How many targets have you killed?</li>
    <li>Do you remember your first kill?</li>
    <li>How did you acquire your unique skillset?</li>
    <li>Does your character struggle with any form of guilt?</li>
    <li>What made you leave your previous life and start adventuring?</li>
   </ol>
   <p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Non-Good</p>
   <p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Assassination</i>. You may expend 2 willpower to mark a target for assassination. On the next turn, the first attack that results in a critical hit becomes an assassination and deals an additional 15 damage.</p>

   <h5><a id="Barbarian"></a>Barbarian</h5>
   <p>Whether a local farmhand or a tribesman from a remote tundra or jungle, barbarians are united by their unparalleled fury in battle, as well as sheer physical brawn. By tapping into primal rage, barbarians can strike harder and faster than anyone else while laughing off blows that would stagger an ordinary man. Barbarians typically wear light armor, and swing the largest weapons they can find. Their bodies are often covered in scars, either from tribal initiation rituals, or past battles. Some barbarians channel their rage in a drunken stupor, while others transform into the animals that embody their inner beast.</p>
   <p>While writing the backstory for a barbarian, consider the following:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Have you always been strong, or did you go through a lot of training?</li>
    <li>Is your immense brawn shared by other members of your family or tribe?</li>
    <li>When did you first discover that rage could make you stronger?</li>
    <li>What made you leave your previous life and start adventuring?</li>
   </ol>
   <p><b>Alignment Suggestion</b>: Chaotic</p>
   <p><b>Core Ability</b>: <i>Rage</i>. You may spend 3 willpower to enter a rage for 5 combat turns. During a rage, your strength is increased by 3. If you are not wearing armor, you also gain 3 resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, and fire damage. You may not cast spells, read scrolls, or use consumables without ending your rage. Note: when an ability increases your rage level, it increases your strength and resistance by the indicated amount and also resets the rage duration to 5 turns.</p>

     <p><b>Limitations</b>: Due to their careless approach and lack of formal education, barbarians start with a deficiency in two of the following three skills: <a class="tooltip"><u>sorcery</u><span>Practical knowledge of magic, including the speedy recall and correct execution of verbal and somatic spell components.</span></a>, <a class="tooltip"><u>literacy</u><span>Measures knowledge that would usually be obtained via formal education or reading books, such as philosophy, mathematics, economics, or history.

Used when attempting to recognize monsters at the start of combat.</span></a>.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 2, you develop a terrifying primal roar. As an action, you can spend 1 willpower to roar, potentially terrifying nearby enemies. Each enemy must pass an <b>NST</b> saving throw or become <a class="tooltip"><u>Terrified</u><span>Terrified beyond rational measure, the target is compelled to take the move away from the source of its fear each turn before taking any other actions.</span></a>. The DT of the saving throw is equal to your <b>NST</b> attribute score.</p>

     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 4, your rage deepens. When you get a kill during a rage, you can expend 1 willpower to increase your rage level by 1.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 5, your proficiency in martial arts advances to expertise.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 6, magic is stupid, but you can make it go away by yelling at it. Enemies which fail their saving throw against your roar may not cast spells on their next turn, and lose concentration on any spells they have already cast.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 7, increase your proficiency level in one of these skills: initiative, mobility, or survival.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 8, your rage sustains you in your darkest hour. Once per turn, when you take damage while below half hp, your rage level increases by 1.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 11, Your skill in martial arts advances to mastery.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 14, increase your proficiency level in two of these skills: initiative, mobility, or survival.</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 25px;">At level 15, gain the ability to enter a blackout rage. Entering a blackout rage costs 10 willpower, and immediately increases your rage level to 10 (instead of 3). After your first blackout rage, you either gain a permanent rage level of 1, or you reconsider your life choices and become a monk. As a monk, you keep your barbarian starting gear and proficiencies, but lose your barbarian rage ability and class abilities.</p>

   <h5><a id="Hermit"></a>Hermit</h5>
   <p>A hermit is someone who has chosen to live alone, usually on the outskirts of civilization. Such prolonged solitude leaves one with countless hours of quiet contemplation, and the slow progression from idiosyncrasy to eccentricity and madness. Alone in the wilderness, it is only a matter of time before one's most savage and primal instincts begin to dominate. Then comes the choice of whether to resist the madness or embrace it wholeheartedly, but this too is only a matter of time. In the end, there comes a day when that which lumbers out of the hermit's hut is more beast than man.</p>
   <p>Whether by some inborn ability or through countless hours of meditation, a hermit is someone who has developed the ability to transform at will into a particular animal. Unlike a druid who can transform into a wide variety of small animals, a hermit can only transform into one type of animal. But what a hermit sacrifices in flexibility, they gain in power. Hermits are known for transforming into mighty animals such as the direwolf, rune bear, lions, and even the mighty rhinoceros.</p>
   <p>While writing the backstory for a hermit, consider the following:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>How did you learn to transform into your specific animal?</li>
    <li>Have you always had a close connection to nature, or did something spur that connection?</li>
    <li>What was your first transformation like?</li>
    <li>Do you feel more at home as a humanoid or as an animal?</li>

   <h5><a id="Knight"></a>Knight</h5>
   <p>The knight is a low-ranking noble with formal combat training. Although they may be called to fight in battle, a knight’s primary purpose is to serve for the glory of their Lord or Lady, to whom they have sworn an oath of fealty. Many knights are also accompanied by a squire, a young knight in training who may carry their lord’s banner or help them don and doff their armor.</p>
   <p>On the battlefield, a knight is a magnificent sight, clad in expensive steel plate armor and with their lord’s ensignia emblazoned on their shield. However, some knights forgo a shield altogether, preferring a heavier two-handed weapon. Either way, knights train extensively and are rarely caught flat-footed, even when out of armor</p>
   <p>While writing the backstory for a knight, consider the following:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Did you train as a page or a squire before becoming a knight?</li>
    <li>Are you proud of your country and your liege, or have you become disillusioned?</li>
    <li>Was your oath of fealty inspired by love, respect, or political convenience?</li>

   <h5><a id="Thief"></a>Thief</h5>
   <p>Thieves are found in every city and village and borough, in every corner of the world. Their techniques are as varied as you can imagine, but they have one thing in common: the ability to disappear quickly and quietly. This skill proves immensely useful for those that turn to the path of adventuring, for one cannot easily be killed if one is not seen. Of course, the occasional coinpurse snipped from the belt of an unsuspecting noble doesn’t hurt either.</p>
   <p>While writing the backstory for a thief, consider the following:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Do you have any moral qualms about taking things that don’t belong to you?</li>
    <li>Have you ever been in prison?</li>
    <li>Do you have any connections to a crime syndicate?</li>

   <p>Deep in his workshop, the tinker sits hunched over a table full of parts. The sound of clanking and rattling is heard as he searches for this cog, that corkscrew, or a metal shaft. The moon rises high as he works through the dead of night. Perhaps by dawn he emerges, perhaps not. When he does, he is bearing some bizarre contraption. With the winding of a screw, it springs to “life”, another work of eccentric genius. This is the way of a tinker.</p>

   <h5><a id="Witch"></a>Witch (Warlock)</h5>
   <p>Witches and warlocks are a diverse sort, hailing from many walks of life. You may find one in a palace in the very heart of luxury, another in a dingy cave or a squalid coven, and a third in a quaint shack amidst a great forest. Wherever they are found, witches are defined by their immense power, gained from their pact with a supernatural entity. The terms of these pacts are as diverse and as varied as warlocks themselves, and bring danger, madness, and power in equal measure.</p>
   <p>Such pacts are usually made with demonic or fey beings, for angels and dragons have little use of pacts. Demonic patrons typically allow their supplicants to dispose of their power in whatever manner they wish, in exchange for enslavement in the afterlife. Conversely, fey constantly demand small (or not-so-small) favors, but care very little for their supplicant’s eternal fate.</p>
   <p>While writing the backstory for a witch, consider the following:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Why did you seek power in service to a supernatural being?</li>
    <li>Do you believe that your pact will turn out in your favor?</li>
    <li>Do you follow a ritual when you supplicate before your patron?</li>

  <p>In keeping with traditional TTPRGs, we use a simple alignment system to roughly track a character’s motives. The alignment chart has two axes: <i>lawfulness </i>and <i>morality</i>. Lawfulness describes a character’s predictability and their faith (or lack of faith) in ideals. Meanwhile, morality describes a character’s level of empathy and compassion for others, or lack thereof.</p>
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td>Lawful Good</td>
     <td>Neutral Good</td>
     <td>Chaotic Good</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Lawful Neutral</td>
     <td>True Neutral</td>
     <td>Chaotic Neutral</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Lawful Evil</td>
     <td>Neutral Evil</td>
     <td>Chaotic Evil</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>

  <p>A character’s alignment provides a rough guide to how they intend to behave. Of course, a character’s alignment can change over time, and not all actions are perfectly representative of their alignment. Also, certain actions don’t have a middle ground. You either run into a burning orphanage to save the children, or you don’t. Such circumstances can be polarizing, driving character development and pushing neutral characters towards the extremes of morality. Likewise, polarizing events might also serve to disillusion good characters and turn them evil or neutral, or inspire evil characters to reconsider their ways.</p>
  <p>Before we move on, I’d like to dispel some misconceptions regarding lawfulness and the alignment chart in general. First, alignment should always be secondary to a character’s personality. Second, lawfulness is often used to capture two separate ideas. The first interpretation is <i>a tendency to follow laws </i>while the second is <i>a tendency to believe in and adhere to some fixed set of ideals</i>. This leads to confusion because a seemingly lawful paladin could suddenly start breaking laws if they travel to a land where the foreign laws conflict heavily with their ideals. It’s not always clear whether this represents a change in alignment or not. Although there’s no single correct interpretation, I suggest a third interpretation that lawful characters tend to behave according to reason and logic, while chaotic characters behave according to emotion. One advantage of this interpretation is that it allows lawful characters the flexibility to sometimes be driven by pure emotion, and also explains when and why chaotic characters behave unpredictably—as opposed to just providing chaos for the sake of chaos.</p>
  <h4><a id="backstory"></a>Writing a Backstory</h4>
  <p>In a medieval or renaissance setting, very few characters are either physically or financially disposed to go cavorting about on grand adventures slaying dragons and dispatching necromancers and whatnot. Most of the characters in this sort of world are farmers, either working on a manor for their feudal lord or fending for themselves on the edges of civilization. Whether they're tied down by social expectations, afraid of death and the unkown, or just too damn comfortable, the simple fact is that <i>most people are not, and never will be, adventurers</i>.</p>
  <p>So who does go adventuring? If not the cowardly and mediocre, then only the strongest, boldest, and most daring individuals remain. <i>That's you!</i> Whether young or old, rich or poor, man or woman, an adventurer is someone who possesses <i>true courage</i>, and a compelling <i>vision</i>. Whatever your old life was, you're leaving it behind to try something new and exciting. Dangerous, certainly, but also glorious.</p>
  <p>Your backstory can be as long or short as you want it to be. Write from your heart, and create a character that resonates with you. As you write your backstory, try to think about what drove them to abandon their old life and become an adventurer. Here are some general questions to get you started:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Is your character the sort to make elaborate plans, or do they react to the world around them on the fly?</li>
   <li>Has anyone in their family ever been an adventurer? Are they inspired by legends of adventurers past?</li>
   <li>Does the idea of protecting the innocent and vulnerable resonate with your character?</li>
   <li>Was your character displaced by a natural disaster, such as a fire or flood?</li>
   <li>Has your character known financial extremes, such as wealth or poverty?</li>
   <li>What do they hope to find as an adventurer? Some adventurers seek fame, money, friendship, or true love, while others seek revenge or even adventure itself.</li>
   <li>Is your character leaving anything behind in their decision to go adventuring? Perhaps family, an ancestral home or village, or a spouse?</li>
   <li>How does your character come across to others? Are they amiable, eccentric, softspoken, confident, or perhaps dark and brooding?</li>
   <li>How does your character feel about the downsides of adventuring, such as death, injury, or poverty?</li>
   <li>Are there any unresolved threads from their old life that could come back to haunt them, such as a sworn enemy, estranged family, or the law?</li>
  </ol>
  <h4><a id="equipment"></a>Starting Equipment</h4>
  <p>Starting equipment depends heavily on your character's class. Some classes are well-prepared, bringing several unique items for unforeseen situations. Others have more scant preparations, bringing hardly more than the clothes on their back and a smattering of food and gold. If you do not feel your character's initial gear is appropriate for your character, discuss this with your DM. If they agree, you can exchange some of your starting gear for gold or items of equivalent value.</p>
  <p>Most classes also start with an initial sum of gold, which may be spent at a merchant or on combat training. You can supplement your character's gear by visiting a merchant before your adventure starts. The <a href="appendix_items.html">Appendix: Mercantile Goods</a> lists typical merchant wares available for purchase. If you do plan to make a trip to a merchant, be considerate and plan your purchases in advance, to avoid an extended shopping spree.</p>
  <p>Once you've completed steps 1-5, you're now ready to fill out your character sheet. This is covered in the next chapter.</p>
