  <p>Combat is pure chaos. It's nothing like the movies; you won't find any choreographed fencing with somersaults and pirouettes, dramatic music, or witty banter. Real combat is full of noise and blood and grime, broken bones, and the screams of the dyingâ€”or the eerie silence of the dead. Be that as it may, mortal combat is actually the most advanced form problem-solving on a great many worlds. So you'd better get good at it.</p>
  <p>In order to make sense out of chaos, the battlefield is represented with a grid and time is divided into <i>turns</i> and <i> rounds</i>. Each grid square represents a 6-by-6 foot square of terrain, while a turn of combat captures a single fighter doing their best to kill and not be killed for a single 6-second snapshot of time. Finally, a round is completed when all combatants have completed their turn. Once combat has started, it continues through as many rounds as it needs to until only one faction remains, and all others have either surrendered, fled, or been slain. Then it ends, as quickly as it began.</p>

  <h4><a id="battlefield"></a>The Battlefield</h4>
  <p>Battles are usually represented in one of three ways:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A battlemap, with minis or markers representing the combatants</li>
   <li>A Virtual Tabletop (VTT)</li>
   <li>Theater of the Mind, with positioning described verbally by the DM</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks, but a physical battlemap offers the best experience in my opinion. Players have a visual and tactile representation of the battlefield, and there are no technical difficulties to worry about like websockets and port forwarding. The main downside of battlemaps is that they can become a bit expensive, and they only work for in-person sessions.</p>
  <p>When playing on a battlemap or a virtual tabletop, the battlefield is represented as a rectangular grid. Each tile is a six foot (or 2 meter) square, containing at most one combatant. Ordinarily, combatants can move or attack into any of these eight adjoining squares, unless the square is impassible or contains some sort of hazard.</p>
  <p>When playing without a battlemap, the DM verbally describes the layout of the battlefield, including the positioning of any hazards or attackers the characters can see. Players respond by describing their intended actions, or asking questions about what moves are or are not available. Combat proceeds in a similar way as when there is a battlemap, although complex positioning and tactics are not practically viable.</p>
  <h4><a id="beginning"></a>Beginning Combat</h4>
  <h5>Initiative</h5>
  <p>Combat begins with a skill check, as both players and npc combatants roll for initiative. This determines move order, with higher scores moving first. In <i>All That Glitters</i>, rolling for initiative is an ordinary event roll, and all other rules such as proficiency bonuses apply. When a monster and a player roll the same initiative, players move first. Two players rolling the same initiative may either reach an agreement about who moves first or roll a d20 to decide, while monsters rolling the same initiative move in whatever order the storyteller decides.</p>
  <h5>Recognition</h5>
  <p>Optionally, the DM may decide to ask players to roll for recognition to see the stats of the monsters they are about to fight. This normally includes their HP, AP, attributes, mitigation, and some of their spells, attacks, or abilities. This check depends on the survival skill and its DT is determined by the rarity of the monsters in question:</p>
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>Monster Rarity</th>
     <th>Interpretation</th>
     <th>Typical DT</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Common</td>
     <td>The monster's physicalities are thoroughly documented in literature, and it is encountered by humans somewhat frequently.</td>
     <td>18</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Rare</td>
     <td>The monster has been seen before, but not studied thoroughly. It may have been years to decades since the last sighting.</td>
     <td>24</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Legendary</td>
     <td>The monster has not been sighted in perhaps a century or more. Many doubt that it still exists, or ever existed.</td>
     <td>30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Exotic</td>
     <td>No human has ever seen the monster and lived to tell the tale.</td>
     <td>Impossible</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>The recognition roll is normally made with disadvantage if the area is obscured by heavy fog or darkness. Conversely, players may roll with advantage if attempting to discern monsters that emit distinctive noises or smells. If successful, the players gain knowledge of the monster's HP, attacks, and mitigation stat, and any other information the <a class="tooltip"><u>storyteller</u><span>The person who controls the characters, setting, and story.</span></a> chooses to reveal. If there are several monsters attacking together, the roll should be done in one go rather than rolling recognition separately for each unique type of monster in the encounter.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Sometimes, players may have a chance to view their enemies from a distance before they are recognized. In this case, they may roll for recognition before combat begins, possibly with advantage.</p>
  <h5>Surprise</h5>
  <p>During an ambush or surprise attack, sometimes the defenders are so completely discombobulated that they are unable to react decisively. This condition is called <i>surprise</i> and has the following effects:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Defenders cannot make recognition rolls</li>
   <li>Defenders make their initiative rolls with disadvantage.</li>
   <li>Defenders cannot take reactions until their first turn.</li>
   <li>Any attackers which move before <i>all</i> defenders may take part in a bonus combat round, giving them an extra chance to attack.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Surprise is triggered if the ambushing party succeeds a stealth check against the defending party. If the attackers have already succeeded a stealth check, they do not need to make an additional one. See <a href="../6_noncombat/c6.html#Sneaking">here</a> for more information on stealth tactics.</p>
  <h4><a id="actions"></a>Taking Actions</h4>
  <p>At the beginning of every combat turn, players gain one main hand action, one offhand action, and movement points equal to their speed attribute. The various actions taken during the turn deplete these resources until the player has no more abilities to use, at which point their turn ends. Monsters may have more or fewer actions than human players, but otherwise their combat turns proceed in essentially the same way.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Some combat actions, such as a two-handed weapon attack, use both the main hand and offhand action.</p>
  <h4><a id="Reacting"></a>Reacting</h4>
  <p>Reactions are moves a character makes in response to specific triggers, such as an enemy moving into or out of melee range. Characters use reactions before their turn starts, and normally may make one reaction per turn. Common examples of reactions include parrying, blocking with a shield, and opportunity attacks.</p>
  <p>For example, if a player is engaged in melee combat with a monster that turns and runs away, the player can make a reaction called an opportunity attack. The opportunity attack allows the player to make a main hand (or two handed) weapon attack against the monster outside the player's normal turn. Most monsters are also capable of scoring opportunity attacks against players, but players can use the disengage action to avoid this. Disengage allows the player to move out of melee range without triggering the opportunity attack reaction, useful for repositioning.</p>
  <p>The following chart displays some actions and reactions typically available to players:</p>

  <h4><a id="attacking"></a>Attack and Defense</h4>
  <p>The actions most commonly taken during a turn are those that deal damage. Attacks are handled in two parts, the first being an attack roll to determine whether the attack connects, and the second being a damage roll to determine how much damage is dealt. The attack roll is an ordinary skill check for martial arts (for melee), accuracy (for ranged), or other skills for the various schools of magic. The DT of the attack roll is the mitigation stat of the target.</p>
  <h5>Defending</h5>
  <p>The defender can increase their mitigation temporarily by blocking (with an offhand action) or parrying (with a reaction). A few special rules apply to blocking and parrying:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>It is not possible to block and parry in the same turn. Blocking prevents parrying from being taken as a reaction.</li>
   <li>A defender can choose which attack to parry, but cannot choose to parry an attack after the attack roll for that attack has already been made.</li>
   <li>A defender can parry at most one attack per turn.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Damage</h5>
  <p>To determine the damage of an attack that has connected, roll the weaponâ€™s damage dice and add your <a href="c3.html#modifier">modifier</a> for that weapon's attribute (usually strength). For example, if your character has 14 strength and attacks with a cutlass, you would roll the weapon's damage die (a d6) and add 4 damage. If you rolled a 3, you would deal 7 damage: 3 from the die, and 4 from your strength modifier. To give another example, a pike has a damage die of 1d12 and either speed or strength may be used as its attribute. A character with 12 strength and 14 speed would add their speed modifier to the polearm's damage die of 1d12. If they rolled an 8 on the 1d12, they would deal a total of 12 damage: 8 from the die, and 4 from their speed modifier.</p>
  <p>Attack rules for spells are similar, but vary depend on the precise spell in question. Many spells partially or completely bypass ordinary mitigation or hit an entire area at once. In such cases, the target usually makes a saving throw to avoid full damage, rather than the caster trying to pass an ability check to cast the spell.</p>
  <h5><a id="Critical_Hits"></a>Critical Hits</h5>
  <p>Not all attacks are created equal. Sometimes a blade strikes exceptionally true, piercing all defenses. When this happens, the blow is called a critical hit. Critical hits are triggered when the attacker rolls above the <i>critical threshold </i> (abbreviated CT) on the attack roll before any bonuses including proficiencies are applied. Normaly, the CT is 20, but certain bonuses lower the threshold, making it easier to score critical hits.</p>
  <p>When a critical hit lands, a few special rules apply:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The attack always connects, even if the enemy's MIT is higher than the total value rolled.</li>
   <li>The attack deals additional damage, gaining one bonus die for every damage die in the base attack.</li>
   <li>The first bonus die always takes its maximum value.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, if a knight with 15 STR rolls a critical hit with a longsword, he would normally deal 5+1d10 damage. On a critical hit, he would roll 15+1d10 damage, because there is only one hit die, so the bonus die takes its maximum value. If a wizard rolled a critical hit with a spell dealing 3d8 damage, the spell would deal 8+5d8 damage, with 3d8 being the base spell damage, 2d8 from bonus dice, and 8 from the bonus die taking maximum value.</p>
  <h4><a id="moving"></a>Moving</h4>
  <p>At the start of their turn, characters gain movement points equal to half their speed attribute score. When moving around on a rectangular battle grid, players expend 1 movement point for every vertical, horizontal, or diagonal move. Optionally, players can opt to use fractional movement points. Under this system, diagonal movement costs 1.5 movement points, effectively making the set of reachable tiles more circular. This also makes odd movement points more relevant, but increases the complexity of maneuvering. In any case, a character cannot enter a tile unless they have the required amount of movement points remaining. For example, a character with 5.5 movement points would be able to move at most 5 tiles horizontally or vertically.</p>
  <p>In a 5-second combat round with 5-foot square tiles, a speed of 10 (average) translates to 5 feet per second, or around 3.5 miles per hours. This implies a typical jog speed of 7 miles per hour, and a sprint speed of 14 miles per hours.</p>
  <h4><a id="grappling"></a>Grappling</h4>
  <p>A player can attempt to grapple an enemy by using both a main and offhand action. The attacker and the defender then both roll a martial arts skill check, with the grapple succeeding if the attacker's score is greater than or equal to the defender's score. Once grappled, the defender cannot move or take main or offhand actions during their turn. However, they can reroll their martial arts check once each turn, until their score is higher than the score rolled by the attacker. At this point, they are no longer grappled and will be able to move and act normally on their next turn.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Relative size affects grappling chances, as follows: If a character attempts to grapple an enemy that is smaller than themselves, they gain advantage on the martial arts check. If they attempt to grapple an enemy larger than themselves, they gain disadvantage. No character may grapple a character more than one size class larger than they are.</p>
  <p>During a grapple, a few special rules take effect:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The DC of both combatants is reduced to zero, lowering their MIT.</li>
   <li>The grappled character's BC is added to the attacker's BC.</li>
   <li>The grappled character acts as a meatshield, taking full damage from failed attacks against the grappling character.</li>
   <li>A character can attempt to break an ally free from being grappled by using the help action. In this case, both characters roll for martial arts. If either roll is higher than the grappler's martial arts roll, the grapple condition ends.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If a player is grappling an enemy at the start of their turn, their moveset is restricted to the following actions:</p>
  <p><b>Dragging</b>: The character moves at half speed, bringing the grappled foe along with them.</p>
  <p><b>Throwing</b> costs a main and offhand action. The player makes a strength check with a DT equal to the enemy's strength score. If successful, the throw distance is 5 feet plus an additional foot for every point their strength check exceeded the enemy's strength score.</p>
  <p><b>Regrappling</b> costs a main and offhand action and allows the grappler to reroll the initial martial arts check of the grapple with advantage, potentially increasing the DT of the defender's check to break free on subsequent turns. However, if the new grapple score is lower than the defender's original grapple score, the defender immediately breaks free from the grapple. Regrappling is mainly useful if the attacker's initial grapple score was lower than expected, and the defender is likely to break out on future turns.</p>
  <p><b>Releasing</b> an enemy costs no effort, and the grappler can move and attack as normal on their turn. They will have to pass another martial arts check to grapple the enemy again, but have advantage on attack rolls against the same creature.</p>
  <h4><a id="defeat"></a>Defeat</h4>
  <p>When a monster or player character loses all their hitpoints, they can no longer fight and fall unconscious. What happens to a player character at this point depends on whether you are playing according to permadeath or modern rules.</p>
  <p>Under permadeath rules, downed players rolls a DT 12 <a class="tooltip"><u>survival</u><span>Measures general survival skills, including the ability to recognize threats, build shelter, and live off the land. Used when attempting to recognize monsters at the start of combat.</span></a> saving throw on their turn. After three saves, they become stable and do not need to make additional saves to stay alive. However, if a character accumulates three fails, they are dead and can only be revived by powerful resurrection magic. Under this system, players can be revived and resume fighting after being healed by any healing spell, as long as they have not actually died.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: Under permadeath rules, rolling a natural 20 immediately causes the player to become stable.</p>
  <p>The modern rules offer an alternative system where unconscious players do not need to make saving throws to stay alive. However, they also do not regain consciousness after being healed by healing magic. Instead, they regain consciousness 1d4 hours after combat is over.</p>
  <p>In gameplay strategy, modern rules prioritize keeping the characters conscious, making single-target healing spells quite valuable. Permadeath rules favor mass healing spells that resurrect the character whenever they fall. You should think carefully about which system works best for you.</p>
  <h4><a id="damage_types"></a>Damage Types</h4>
  <p>Smashing, slashing, poisoning, burningâ€¦ There are quite a few ways to do someone in. When damage is dealt by an attack or spell, it always comes with a damage type that modifies the original effect. Here's a list of damage types and their unique effects:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #CFF"><b>Slashing</b></span><br>
    The target's DC is reduced by 2 until the start of their next turn.<br>
    Inflicted by bladed weapons such as swords and axes, or the claws of wild animals.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #FFF"><b>Piercing</b></span><br>
    Critical hit damage is doubled.<br>
    Inflicted by arrows, spears, and swords, or the fangs of monsters.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #888"><b>Bludgeoning</b></span><br>
    When a bludgeoning attack is blocked, the target still takes half damage.<br>
    Inflicted by hammers, hooves or fists, and falling damage.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #F80"><b>Heat</b></span><br>
    The target gains one level of burning.<br>
    Inflicted by burning creatures, pyromantic magic, or the breath of dragons.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #4BF"><b>Cold</b></span><br>
    The target gains one level of freezing.<br>
    Inflicted by frost spells or environmental hazards such as blizzards or icy water.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #D00"><b>Force</b></span><br>
    Liable to knock the target prone.<br>
    Inflicted by explosions, and certain spells</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #FF4"><b>Lightning</b></span><br>
    Deals 1 Deals half damage versus opponents wearing metal armor.<br>
    Inflicted by lightning or storm spells</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #AF0"><b>Acid</b></span><br>
    Erodes armor. Target BC is reduced by 1 if the attack is not dodged.<br>
    Inflicted by bile, acidic venom, and certain alchemical mixtures.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #4D0"><b>Poison</b></span><br>
    Carries with it additional effects dependant on the type of poison.<br>
    Inflicted by poisoned blades, the claws and fangs of venomous beasts, and certain spells.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #FFA"><b>Holy</b></span><br>
    An extraordinarily bright light of divine origin. Deals double damage to evil and the undead, but only half to good.<br>
    Inflicted by radiant lights, solar astrology, and theurgical summons.</li>
   <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #92F"><b>Profane</b></span><br>
    A sickening miasma of spiritual darkness. Deals double damage to good-aligned creatures, but only half to evil.<br>
    Inflicted by lunar astrology, necromantic spells, and demonic summons.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A few notes on damage types:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>When a character takes force damage exceeding their strength score, they must make a strength saving throw with DT equal to the force damage dealt or be knocked prone.</li>
   <li>Metal armor protects the wearer from lightning damage by acting as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNxDgd3D_bU">faraday cage</a>.</li>
   <li>Successful attacks with acid decrease the target's BC by 1, until zero. The armor can be repaired at a blacksmith for 20 gold per BC lost.</li>
   <li>Good-aligned characters possess resistance to holy damage, and vulnerability to profane damage. Conversely, evil-aligned characters and the undead possess resistance to profane damage and vulnerability to holy damage.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Vulnerability, Resistance, and Immunity</h5>
  <p>Besides their inherent effects, damage types may deal differing amounts of damage to creatures depending on their vulnerabilities. Every creature has one of four levels of vulnerability to each damage type, modifying incoming damage of that type as follows:</p>
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td>Vulnerable</td>
     <td>Damage is doubled</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Normal</td>
     <td>No effect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Resistant</td>
     <td>Damage is halved</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Immune</td>
     <td>Damage is voided</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <h4><a id="status_effects"></a>Status Effects</h4>
  <p>Sometimes characters fall prey to certain temporary conditions that reduce their effectiveness in combat. These conditions are called status effects and begin and end under certain conditions. Also, some status effects can accumulate, meaning they can be inflicted multiple times on the same character.</p>

  <ul>
   <li>1 point of healing cancels out 1 point of bleeding.</li>
   <li>When using the help action to treat bleeding, the character providing assistance must pass a <a class="tooltip"><u>medicine</u><span>Measures knowledge of disease and wound treatment.</span></a> check (DT equal to twice the bleeding amount). On a success, bleeding is reduced by half.</li>
   <li>Freezing and burning status effects are mutually exclusive. One turn of freezing cancels out one turn of burning, and vice versa.</li>
