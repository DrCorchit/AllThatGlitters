  <p>Outside of combat, most events are fairly open-ended and subject to DM discretion. However, certain actions do have predefined rules, for consistency and balance. These are listed below:</p>

  </ol>
  <h4><a id="resting"></a>Resting</h4>
  <p>Over time, your characters become ragged and weary as they take damage and expend AP during combat. Although some HP and AP can be recovered with potions or abilities, most recovery is done through resting. There are three kinds of rests:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Holiday</b>: The party spends several nights in or around a town, resting and relaxing or drinking and carousing as they will. All HP and AP are restored, and all status conditions are recovered. Holiday costs 10 gold per adventurer per night, and grants 1d6 temporary HP and 1d4 temporary WP. Players can reroll these dice up to three times by taking additional days on holiday.</li>
   <li><b>Night's Rest</b>: All HP and AP are restored. The entire party makes camp and sleeps for 8 hours, completing the adventuring day. If in the wilderness, this typically involves setting up camp, building a fire, cooking dinner, and so forth. In villages and towns, it usually involves a night at an inn. Taking a long rest consumes a day's rations, or 5 gold when resting at an inn. It's not possible to long rest inside certain areas, such as a fortress controlled by the enemy or a hostile wilderness or dungeon.</li>
   <li><b>Breather</b>: The party sits down for an hour or so to dress their wounds and catch their breath. Each player recovers 1d8 HP and 1d4 AP. This amount increases at higher levels, as follows: 
    <table>
     <tbody>
      <tr>
       <th>Level</th>
       <th>HP recovered</th>
       <th>WP recovered</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>1</td>
       <td>1d8</td>
       <td>1d4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

       <td>16</td>
       <td>5d8</td>
       <td>1d12</td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table> The party can take at most two breathers between long rests, possibly back to back.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><a id="working"></a>Working</h4>
  <p>At times, players may decide to earn money by plying various trades. Each trade pays a certain amount on a daily basis, sometimes dependent on one or more skill checks. However, adventurers are not particularly fond of regular work, and therefore rarely take such jobs for more than a month. One the occasions where they do take such jobs, the pay is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Farming &amp; Manual Labor</b>: Pay is low, but honest. A player who engages in this sort of activity earns 3 gold per day.</li>
   <li><b>Guarding</b>: Offers higher pay than other unskilled jobs at 5 gold per day. If the players are directly attacked while guarding, they roll for <a class="tooltip"><u>defense</u><span>Skill at defensive maneuvers and tactics, in particular armor and shields.</span></a> to handle the situation. If not, the DM may have the players roll for <a class="tooltip"><u>perception</u><span>The ability to discern more than is immediately obvious. When attempting to perceive a character’s honesty or motives, charisma becomes the base stat.</span></a>. If the players fail to observe a crime that was committed, they may be docked a day's pay or dismissed from guard duty. Players should roll for these events roughly once for every week of guard duty.</li>
   <li><b>Performing</b>: At most one player can take this job per tavern per night. The base pay depends on the player's <a class="tooltip"><u>performance</u><span>Captures a player's ability to sing, dance, play instruments, or otherwise entertain a crowd. Proficiency with this skill implies the ability to play at least one musical instrument.</span></a> roll: Below 16: 1 gold. At or above 16: 1d10 gold. On a critical success, the player earns 1d20 gold. If the player has master level performance, the roll is made with advantage. If performing for more than a few nights, the player can take the average of three nights as their daily pay.</li>
   <li><b>Hunting &amp; Fishing</b>: Player engaged in this activity make a DT 15 <a class="tooltip"><u>survival</u><span>Measures general survival skills, including the ability to recognize threats, build shelter, and live off the land. Used when attempting to recognize monsters at the start of combat.</span></a> check. On a success, they acquire enough fish, fowl, or game to feed themselves and one other player for one night. On a critical success, they feed the entire party. If near a town, the quarry can instead be sold for 10 or 20 gold, respectively. If attempted in an inhospitable environment, the DM may impose disadvantage or forbid hunting altogether.</li>
   <li><b>Transcribing</b>: If there is an employer hiring for this type of work, the player may be able to take employment as a scribe. The player must be at least proficient in literacy and also pass a DT 15 <a class="tooltip"><u>literacy</u><span>Measures knowledge that would usually be obtained via formal education or reading books, such as philosophy, mathematics, economics, or history. Deficiency in this skill normally indicates that the character is illiterate.</span></a> check to convince the employer that they are suitable for this type of work. If successful, they may work as a scribe for some time, transcribing dictations, copying manuscripts, and the like. Pay is 5 gold per day.</li>
   <li><b>Healing</b>: The base pay depends on a <a class="tooltip"><u>medicine</u><span>Measures knowledge of disease and wound treatment.</span></a> check. On a critical fail, the player earns no money and cannot continue to practice medicine. Below 12, and the pay is 1 gold. 12 or above, and the pay is 1d8. On a critical success, pay is 1d20. If healing for more than a few days, the player can take the average of three days as their daily pay.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><a id="traveling"></a>Traveling</h4>
  <p>When traveling long distance overland, there are a number of concerns: travel time, food, water, bandits, weather, and road quality. Of these, food and bandits are the most troublesome.</p>
  <h5>Travel Time</h5>
  <p>The amount of distance covered per day depends greatly on the physical fitness of the traveler, trail and weather conditions, and other factors such as mounts. A character's long distance hiking speed over even terrain is equal to half their speed score in feet per seconds. For a character with a speed score of 10, this is about 3.4 miles per hour. Players can travel at this speed for around 8 hours per day.</p>
  <p>25-30 miles is a reasonable distance for a party to cover per day, provided they follow established roads. When travelling over rough terrain (such as mountains or dense forests), this distance is halved.</p>
  <h5>Food</h5>
  <p>The basic unit of food is the day's ration. Rations are presumed to consist of nonperishable supplies such as salted meat, pickled vegetables, or hardtack. Each adventurer consumes one ration per day. When rations run out, the party is either forced to hunt, which halves travel speed, or begins starvation.</p>
  <p>Starvation has the following effects:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>After day 3, the party can no longer recover during short rests.</li>
   <li>After day 5, the effect of a long rest is reduced to that of a short rest.</li>
   <li>After day 10, the party can no longer take rests. Skill checks are made with disadvantage.</li>
   <li>Starting on the 14th day, all attributes except speed are reduced by 1 each day. When strength reaches zero, the character perishes of hunger.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The effects of starvation linger even after consuming rations. In the wilderness, characters recover 1 day of hunger every day they consume rations. In villages and towns, 3 days of hunger are recovered per day. It takes a bit more than one week to fully recover from the brink of starvation.</p>
  <h5>Bandits</h5>
  <p>Bandits usually set up ambushes along minor trade routes and between cities, but shy away from the cities themselves and heavily travelled routes. Similarly, pirates roam the seas usually along trade routes. Naturally, all forms of banditry increase during wartime. Bandits and pirates behave differently depending on their class. Yokels and simpleton bandits usually kill their prey outright and loot their pockets. Professional bandits usually investigate their victims and attempt to discern if there is any chance of ransom. Pirates tend to sell their victims as slaves in foreign markets, while privateers tend to seek ransom.</p>
  <p>There are no hard and fast rules for bandit encounters, but a rough understanding of their methods and techniques lends historical accuracy to the campaign.</p>
  <h4><a id="riding"></a>Mounts &amp; Riding</h4>
  <p>There are two types of mounts: normal and huge. Normal mounts such as horses and camels generally carry one rider or a lightly loaded cart, and allow their rider to engage in melee combat. Huge mounts such as elephants can carry more riders and pull more weight, but render melee combat impossible. The following rules apply to both types of mounts, unless otherwise stated.</p>
  <h5>Mounted Combat</h5>
  <p>During mounted combat, rider and mount have separate HP and willpower pools, and are targeted separately. The rider and mount share an initiative score and move and act together, but the mount does not take actions. Riders and mounts gain certain bonuses while moving. For these purposes, a mount is considered to be moving if it has moved in its previous or current turn.</p>
  <p>A number of special rules apply to mounted combat:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Neither riders nor mounts incur opportunity attacks.</li>
   <li>Riders have disadvantage on ranged attacks while moving. The "keshik" feat removes this penalty.</li>
   <li>Riders of huge mounts cannot make melee attacks, and cannot be melee attacked.</li>
   <li>Melee attacks against riders have disadvantage. If the mount is moving, melee attacks against it also have disadvantage.</li>
   <li>Attackers with polearms do not suffer disadvantage when attacking riders or mounts, and can make opportunity attacks against mounts.</li>
   <li>The hitpoints of a mount are equal to twice its strength score.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Pace and Speed</h5>
  <p>When riding a mount, a player's movement speed is replaced with the speed of their mount. Mounts travel at one of four paces: walk, trot, canter, or gallop. At a walking pace, a mount's speed (in tiles per turn) is one quarter of its <b>SPD</b> attribute. For a typical riding horse, this is around 4 miles per hour. A mount can walk comfortably for up to eight hours without suffering from exhaustion, even while carrying a rider or pulling a cart (over level terrain). This is the ideal pace for long distances, but unremarkable for combat.</p>
  <p>A mount (not the rider) can expend 1 willpower to increase its pace, doubling its movement speed each level.</p>
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>Pace</th>
     <th>Speed (tiles/turn)</th>
     <th>Cost</th>
     <th>Maximum Duration</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Walk</td>
     <td>1/4 * <b>SPD</b></td>
     <td>—</td>

     <td>2 * <b>SPD</b></td>
     <td>3 Willpower</td>
     <td>2 minutes</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>These speeds apply to mounts which are carrying a single rider or a cart with a light load. When an unladen and unmounted animal moves, it expends half as much willpower when trotting or galloping. Conversely, a mount carrying two riders or a heavy load must expend twice as much willpower in order to trot, and cannot canter or gallop.</p>
  <h5>Additional Rules</h5>
  <ul>
   <li>A player can mount a rideable feral animal by passing a DT 18 <a class="tooltip"><u>nature</u><span>Measures background knowledge that would usually be obtained by spending time in nature or around animals. Used when casting nature spells.</span></a> check. Failing the check, the rider must make a DT 12 <b>STR</b> saving throw or be thrown off. The rider can continue to make checks until they succeed or are thrown off.</li>
   <li>When a mount dies, the rider is thrown from its back and must make a DT 16 <a class="tooltip"><u>mobility</u><span>The ability to climb, mantle, vault, and otherwise navigate past obstacles.</span></a> check or else fall prone and lose all actions on their next turn.</li>
   <li>Mounts can have levels, which affect their max HP and recovery during breathers. A mount's level is determined by the DM, and can increase alongside that of its rider.</li>
   <li>A mount can pull weight equal to its deadlift weight as determined by its strength score. A mount can pull up to twice this weight as a heavy load.</li>
   <li>The storyteller may adapt any of these rules to accommodate fantasy mounts such as dragons or pegasi. Such adaptations should be made known to players in advance to avoid confusion.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><a id="swimming"></a>Swimming</h4>
  <p>Whether above or under the water, movement speed is reduced by one half when swimming. A character with a speed score of 10 that normally moves at 5 ft/s would swim at 2.5 ft/s. It's possible to train swimming speed (Athletics Training: Freestyle), to bring swimming up to walking speed.</p>
  <p>Underwater, players can normally hold their breath for 10 seconds per point invested in the strength attribute, after which point they must pass a DT 10 willpower saving throw every ten seconds to avoid drowning. As with swimming speed, this can be improved with training (Athletics Training: Lung Capacity). The same rules apply when holding one's breath for other reasons, such as trying to avoid inhaling toxic fumes.</p>
  <h4><a id="falling"></a>Falling</h4>
  <p>When making a standing jump, players can jump a number of feet equal to one half their speed score. If the player makes a running jump (or takes the move action prior to jumping while in combat), jump distance is equal to their speed score in feet. Jump height is always one half of standing jump distance. Both jump distance and jump height can be increased by athletics training.</p>
  <p>Damage from falling is determined by impact velocity, or how fast a character is moving when they hit the ground. When airborn, characters accelerate downward at roughly 30 feet per second per second, until they reach a maximal velocity due to air resistance. This means that fall damage increases the higher they fall until it reaches a maximum value. <a href="c2.html#Size">Larger characters</a> have a higher terminal velocity and therefore have a higher maximal fall damage.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Fall damage type is always bludgeoning.</li>
   <li>Characters can take fall damage from sources other than falling, such as being hurled into a wall.</li>
   <li>Characters can choose to fall up to twice their terminal velocity by tucking in their limbs and maneuvering into a headfirst position, if so desired.</li>
   <li>Characters can take more damage than their terminal velocity if they are moving faster when they hit the ground. Characters in the air accelerate or decelerate as necessary until they reach their terminal velocity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the purposes of determining fall damage, always round down the player's fall height or impact velocity to match the last row applicable.</p>

  <h4><a id="sneaking"></a>Sneaking</h4>
  <p>Sneaking is handled through a <a class="tooltip"><u>stealth</u><span>Used when sneaking or attempting to perform actions without being seen. Speed cannot be used if the noise of sprinting would arouse excessive suspicion.</span></a> ability check. The default roll required to evade detection is 10. The difficulty is affected by noise, lighting, and other circumstances, as follows:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Total Darkness: -5 to the DT</li>
   <li>Dim Lighting: 0 to the DT</li>
   <li>Bright Lighting: +10 to the DT</li>
   <li>Absolute Silence: +3 to the DT</li>
   <li>Light background noise: 0 to the DT</li>
   <li>Heavy background noise: -3 to the DT</li>
   <li>Obscuring fog or smoke, partial cover (such as a crowd): -3 to the DT</li>
   <li>Invisibility: -8 to DT. Lighting and obscurement have no further effect on the DT.</li>
   <li>Actively sought: The seeker's <a class="tooltip"><u>perception</u><span>The ability to discern more than is immediately obvious. When attempting to perceive a character’s honesty or motives, charisma becomes the base stat.</span></a> modifier and proficiency are added to the DT.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As always, the DM may make additional adjustments as necessary.</p>
  <h4><a id="pickpocketing"></a>Pickpocketing</h4>
  <p>Pickpocketing is a risky but potentially rewarding endeavor. To pickpocket, you roll for <a class="tooltip"><u>legerdemain</u><span>Used when lockpicking and pickpocketing items, or other such tricks.</span></a> while your mark (controlled by the DM) rolls for <a class="tooltip"><u>perception</u><span>The ability to discern more than is immediately obvious. When attempting to perceive a character’s honesty or motives, charisma becomes the base stat.</span></a>. If your roll is higher than the mark's role, you successfully pick their pocket. Otherwise, they catch you with your hand in their pocket and act accordingly.</p>
  <p>There are special rules in certain occasions:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>If the mark is in the middle of a crowd, engaged in deep conversation, or similarly distracted they have disadvantage on the perception roll.</li>
   <li>If the mark has their hands in their pockets, they have advantage on the perception roll.</li>
   <li>If you are intoxicated or one of your hands is restrained, you have disadvantage on the legerdemain roll.</li>
   <li>If the city or location has a criminal reputation, the DT of the legerdemain check is increased by 1d6.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When pickpocketing, different types of citizens usually have different amounts of money:</p>

  <h4><a id="lockpicking"></a>Lockpicking</h4>
  <p>Lockpicking is fairly straightforward. To pick a lock, the player must have at least one lockpick in their inventory. They roll a <a class="tooltip"><u>legerdemain</u><span>Used when lockpicking and pickpocketing items, or other such tricks.</span></a> check against the DT of the lock. If it fails, the lockpick is lost, but they may continue attempting to pick the lock if they have additional lockpicks. If successful, the lock is opened. Most locks have a DT of 12-15, but some may be as high as 20.</p>
  <p>Some special rules apply:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>If a guard is watching, you may have to roll for stealth while picking the lock. If you fail the stealth roll, you can continue picking the lock, but will have to deal with the consequences as the guard will notice your lawless behavior.</li>
   <li>If a lock is of an unusual make, the pick can break inside the lock rendering the lock unpickable. The DM should notify the player beforehand if this is likely to occur. The lockpick breaking inside the lock may also happen on a critical failure.</li>
   <li>Some locks may require two picks to be used at a time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><a id="trading"></a>Trading &amp; Haggling</h4>
  <p>Merchants typically have a range of wares available for purchase. Some wares are common and available almost anywehre, while others are exceptionally rare and usually unique to a specific merchant. Commonly available items are listed in these locations:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="appendix_weapons.html">Weapons</a></li>
   <li><a href="appendix_armor.html">Armor</a></li>
   <li><a href="appendix_items.html">Items</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players can attempt to haggle merchants using the <a class="tooltip"><u>persuasion</u><span>Used when engaging in factual debate, intimidation, or deception. Strength becomes the base attribute only when making a threat of physical force.</span></a> skill. A merchant can be haggled up to three times, offering successively larger discounts if the player is able to pass increasingly difficulty persuasion checks. If the player fails any haggle, the merchant becomes obstinate and the discount for that item cannot be increased further. If the player fails to surpass DT 10 on a haggle, the merchant becomes irritated and removes all discounts completely.</p>
  <p>After attempting to haggle a merchant, the same merchant will not allow themselves to be haggled again for some time, unless they are fond of the adventuring party or from a culture where haggling is expected. The DM may impose situational bonuses or penalties to haggling accordingly.</p>
