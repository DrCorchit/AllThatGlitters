</ol>
<h4><a id="Character_Information"></a>Character Information</h4>
<p>This section is found in the topmost right section of the character sheet, and records the most basic information
	about your character, including their name, combat class, level and race. Race, class, and alignment are discussed
	in more detail in the <a href="c2.html" rel="prev">previous chapter</a>. Except for your character level,
	information in this section usually doesn't change.
</p>
<h4><a id="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h4>
<p>Found in the upper right corner, this section tracks several important statistics.</p>
<h5>Hitpoints</h5>
<p>Hitpoints (HP) are a resource that cause the player to fall unconscious when fully depleted. A character’s maximum HP
	is equal to thrice their level plus twice their strength score, but can be increased further by various bonuses.
</p>
<h5>Ability Points</h5>
<p>Ability Points (AP) are expended as the player uses powerful spells and abilities. When AP is fully depleted, the
	character is said to be exhausted. There is not an immediate penalty for this condition, other than not being able
	to use critically necessary abilities. Maximum ability points is equal to a players level plus their willpower
	attribute, but can be increased further by various bonuses.
</p>
<h5>Mitigation</h5>
<p>Mitigation (MIT) is a derived statistic which determines how likely a player is to successfully dodge or block an
	attack, similar to armor class from D&amp;D. During combat, melee and ranged attacks are treated as an event roll
	testing the martial arts or accuracy skill respectively. In this situation, mitigation provides the difficulty
	threshold for whether the attack succeeds. Thus, players with high mitigation are hit less often and therefore
	survive longer.
</p>
<p>Mitigation is composed primarily of two values: dodge chance (DC), conferred by the player’s dexterity attribute, and
	block chance (BC), conferred by the player’s shields and armor. A third value, parry chance, is added when a player
	is actively attempting to parry an attack. The three values are added together to calculate total mitigation, but
	certain attacks may bypass some or all of the three values, reducing effective mitigation against that tactic. For
	example, most types of armor are not ideal for absorbing blows from blunt weapons. Accordingly, bludgeoning damage
	automatically bypasses half of the target’s BC.
</p>
<p>The player’s DC is normally equal to their dexterity attribute, while BC is determined by the player's choice of <a
		href="appendix_armor.html">armor</a>. Parry chance is determined by the character's weapon, if the weapon is
	capable of parrying. If the character is not parrying or their weapon does not allow parrying, parry chance is zero.
	If you're filling out the sheet for the first time, put your dexterity score under DC and your armor BC plus your
	shield BC (if you have one) under BC. Add the two together, and that's your base mitigation stat.
</p>
<h5>Gold</h5>
<p>Gold is the currency of the land, whether pounds, doubloons, or rupees. Gold is used in a variety of ways, mainly to
	buy equipment from merchants, hire trainers, or stock up on camping supplies. In order to simplify the economy, only
	one type of currency is used. If other currencies such as copper or silver pieces, the value is expressed in terms
	of gold. In practical terms, one gold represents about one day's wages for a peasant laborer or farmer.
</p>
<h5>Training Slots</h5>
<p>Training slots are a resource that controls how often a character can learn new abilities from training. You
	temporarily expend training slots whenever you learn a new ability (other than a class ability). If you don't have
	enough training slots for a new ability, you may have to forget an ability to regain the required training slots, or
	wait until you level up. If you're just making a character you won't have used any training slots, so they will be
	at maximum, which is normally equal to your intelligence attribute score.
</p>
<h4><a id="Attributes"></a>Attributes</h4>
<p>The six attributes, <i>Strength</i>, <i>Dexterity</i>, <i>Speed</i>, <i>Intelligence</i>, <i>Charisma</i>, and <i>
	Willpower</i>, describe the raw physical and mental capabilities of a character. Each attribute has a value
	typically from 0 to 20, with a score of 0 indicating a total absence of the attribute (as with someone who is dead
	or unconscious) while a score of 20 indicating a nearly superhuman level of aptitude. For humans, a score of ten
	indicates an average level of proficiency.
</p>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Strength</td>
		<td>Core physical body power</td>
		<td>Melee weapon damage and maximum hitpoints</td>

</table>
<p><br/>In addition to these effects, each attribute supports one or more skills, which are used during event rolls.
	Importantly, each attribute affects multiple aspects of gameplay, meaning that players should care about which stats
	they prioritize and which they neglect. Not every character needs to be well-rounded, but characters with unusual
	ability score distributions should feel somewhat unbalanced to play.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: In most situations, we do not use the attribute score directly, but the <a id="ASM">attribute
	score modifier</a> (ASM). The ASM for an attribute is obtained by subtracting 10 from the attribute score. An
	average human with 10 for all attribute scores would thus have 0 for their attribute score modifiers.
</p>
<p>If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, your attributes are going to be determined by your
	racial and class bonuses. Adding these together should give you 6 numbers. Copy these into the "attributes" section
	and then move on to equipment.
</p>
<h4><a id="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h4>
<h5>Weapons</h5>
<p>This section records your character's equipped weapons and armor. Magical trinkets are not recorded here, but under
	"inventory", even if they are currently being worn.
</p>
<p>To fill out this section, copy down the name and damage of the weapon you chose when you created your character. For
	example, let's suppose you're playing a character with a strength score of 13 and a dexterity score of 15. If you
	chose a longsword, you would write: <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Longsword 1d12+3</span>. The 1d12 is the
	die used by the weapon, while the +3 comes from your strength, because the longsword is a strength weapon. On the
	other hand, if you chose a katana, you would enter <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Katana 1d8+5</span>.
	Since the katana is a nimble weapon, you want to use whichever is higher of strength and dexterity for damage. Since
	15 is higher than 13, you would use dexterity. Finally, write down whichever modifiers apply to that weapon. If you
	run out of space, just write the most important modifiers. You can refer to <a href="appendix_weapons.html">Appendix:
		Weapons</a> for more information on weapons and modifiers.
</p>
<p>A player can carry up to two weapons, as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A single two-handed weapon</li>
	<li>A one-handed weapon, plus a buckler, shield, or small weapon in the offhand</li>
	<li>Two light weapons, such as two shortswords or two daggers</li>
	<li>A light weapon and a greatshield</li>
	<li>A one-handed weapon, with the offhand kept free to cast spells</li>
</ul>
<p>If you only carry one weapon, leave the "offhand" column blank.</p>
<h5>Armor</h5>
<p>Under the "armor" section, write down the type of armor your character is wearing and the associated BC. For example,
	if your character is a knight you would start out wearing half plate. Therefore, you would write <span
			style="font-family: Courier New">Half Plate (BC 8)</span>. If you're not carrying a shield and no other
	bonuses apply, this is the same value as what you entered under "BC" in the "Statistics" section.
</p>
<h4><a id="Skills"></a>Skills</h4>
<p>Skills are related to attributes in that they are also used for event rolls. Every skill has an underlying supporting
	attribute, whose ASM is added to the roll as with an attribute check. In addition to this, players add a bonus from
	training called a proficiency bonus. The number rolled on the d20 plus the ASM plus the proficency bonus determine
	the final value for the event roll.
</p>
<p>Although every skill depends on at least one attribute, several skills have a secondary supporting attribute whose
	modifier may be used instead, under certain circumstances. For example, a player who is sneaking may decide that
	they are too clumsy to move quietly and instead opt to sprint past the guard while his gaze is turned. In this case,
	the player is trying to use their ASM for speed instead of dexterity for the stealth check. Whether this type of
	substitution is used is situational. In fact, certain circumstances <i>require</i> that the alternative attribute
	score modifier is used, while others permit it, in which case it would only be used if the second attribute’s score
	is higher for that character.

</table>
<p>There are five levels of proficiency in each skill. Each proficiency level has a corresponding bonus, as follows:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Deficient</td>
		<td>-2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Proficient</td>
		<td>2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Expert</td>
		<td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mastery</td>
		<td>6</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Each of these labels indicate that the player has either undertaken training or has an especial weakness in that
	skill. Deficiencies can be overcome and expertise and mastery can be attained through training even after a
	character is made.
</p>
<p>When players obtain proficiency bonuses to the same skill from multiple sources, they do not combine to advance one’s
	proficiency in that skill to the next level. The only exception to this rule is that proficiency bonuses from a
	player’s race and class can be combined, allowing a player to begin the game with expert level in that skill.
</p>
<h4><a id="Abilities"></a>Spells &amp; Abilities</h4>
<p>Abilities are learned or innate skills that confer some benefit to the player, such as spells or combat maneuvers.
	Abilities are categorized in a few ways. First, abilities acquired from a player’s class (such as the barbarian’s
	rage) are called innate abilities. Abilities learned from trainers are called trained abilities, and finally trained
	abilities which have been fully mastered are called rote abilities.
</p>
<p>Abilities are also classified by whether or not they are explicitly invoked by the player or if they take effect
	automatically. The former are called active abilities and usually cost AP to activate, while the latter are called
	passive abilities (or perks) and take effect without the use of AP.
</p>
<p>An example of a passive ability would be a perk that restores HP at the start of the player’s turn. Since the player
	is not required to do anything to receive this benefit, it is passive. On the other hand, an ability that allows the
	player to spend AP to deal extra damage would be an active ability.
</p>
<p>In this section, write down the name of any learned or rote abilities you have acquired, followed by the training
	slots used by that ability. Innate abilities don't need to go here, since they are determined by your class. If an
	ability is rote, just leave the "training slots" column for that ability blank. Your training slots
</p>
<h4><a id="Backstory"></a>Backstory &amp; Personality</h4>
<p>This section is highly unique to each character, and describes their origins, their motivations for becoming an
	adventurers, personal goals, as well as character strengths or flaws. There's a lot that can go here, so use your
	judgement and flesh out your character as much as you like.
</p>
<h4><a id="Inventory"></a>Inventory</h4>
<p>The final aspect of your character is their inventory, which includes everything they are carrying other than
	equipped weapons and armor. If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, you should refer to your
	class choice to find your initial loadout. When you find additional items during your adventure, you'll add them
	here. You don't need to add your equipped weapons and armor here, though. Those have their own section on your
	character sheet. If you unequip weapons or armor, don't forget to add them to your inventory.
</p>
<p>Inventory items are categorized as weapons, gear (clothing, armor, and jewelry), tools, and consumables. All of these
	items are stored in your adventurer's pack. If any inventory item is equipped (such as a magic ring or amulet) you
	can put a star or other special mark next to it, to indicate that it is worn. There is no limit to the number of
	magical items you can equip, although you can't gain benefits from wearing multiple items of the same type or on the
	same bodypart. For example, you can't receive the bonuses from two amulets or rings at once, even if your character
	chooses to wear them.
