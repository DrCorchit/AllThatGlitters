  <h4><a id="info"></a>Character Information</h4>
  <p>This section is found in the topmost left section of the character sheet, and records the most basic information about your character, including their name, combat class, level, race, and alignment. Races, classes, and alignments are discussed in more detail in the <a href="c2.html" rel="prev">previous chapter</a>. Except for your character level, information in this section usually doesn't change.</p>
  <h4><a id="stats"></a>Statistics</h4>
  <p>Found in the topmost right corner, this section tracks several important statistics:</p>
  <h5>Hitpoints</h5>
  <p>Hitpoints (HP) measure hardiness and vitality. When a creature's hitpoints fall to zero, they succumb to their wounds and fall unconscious. A character’s maximum HP is initially equal to their strength score and increases each level by one half their strength score. The base value can be bolstered by other effects such as class feature, feats, or magical gear.</p>
  <pre>Max HP = <b>STR</b> + (<b>STR</b> * level / 2)</pre>
  <h5>Willpower</h5>
  <p>Willpower (WP) is expended as the player uses powerful spells and abilities. When WP is fully depleted, the character is said to be exhausted. There is not an immediate penalty for this condition, other than not being able to use critically important abilities. Maximum willpower is equal to 10 plus a player's <b>CHA</b> and <b>NST</b> modifiers.</p>
  <pre>Max WP = 10 + <b>NST</b> modifier + <b>CHA</b> modifier</pre>
  <h5>Mitigation</h5>
  <p>Mitigation (MIT) is a derived statistic which determines how likely a character is to successfully avoid damage from an attack, similar to armor class from D&amp;D. During combat, melee and ranged attacks are treated as an event roll testing the martial arts or accuracy skill of the attacking player. Mitigation provides the difficulty threshold that determines whether the attack succeeds. Thus, players with high mitigation are hit less often and survive longer.</p>
  <p>Mitigation is composed of two values: dodge chance (DC) and block chance (BC). Dodge chance is initially equal to the player’s dexterity attribute, while block chance is determined by the character’s shields and armor. The two values are added together to calculate total mitigation. Note that DC is reduced after every attack by the attacker's <b>DEX</b> modifier, whether the attack is successful or not. Dodge chance is also reduced to zero (for both characters) when a character is grappled.</p>
  <p>DC, BC, and MIT are calculated as follows:</p>
  <pre>DC = <b>DEX</b></pre>
  <pre>BC = armor BC + shield BC</pre>
  <pre>MIT = BC + DC</pre>
  <p style="margin-left:25px;">Note: The character sheet is meant to record the base mitigation statistic. Temporary or conditional bonuses (such as from potions, spells, or parrying) should not be recorded here.</p>
  <p>To calculate effective MIT against an attack, add any circumstantial bonuses or penalties to BC and DC to the base mitigation value. For example, specific potions increase DC, while the parry reaction or certain spells improve BC.</p>
  <h5>Gold</h5>
  <p>Gold measures a character's material wealth, and does not necessarily correspond to a specific number of gold coins or any specific currency. Coins made from other metals such as copper or silver are converted to their gold value when recorded on the character sheet. Gold is mainly used to purchase goods and services, such as buying equipment from merchants or hiring trainers.</p>
  <h5>Status</h5>
  <p>This section records any status effects inflicted on your character.</p>
  <h5>Training Slots</h5>
  <p>Training slots are a resource that control how often a character can learn new abilities from training. Characters expend training slots whenever they learn new feats or spells. If they don't have enough training slots for a new ability, they may have to forget an ability to regain the required training slots, or wait until they level up. If you're just making a character, you won't have used any training slots, so they will be at maximum, which is equal to your intelligence attribute score. Training slots are explained in more detail in <a href="c6.html">chapter 6</a>.</p>
  <pre>Max Training Slots = <b>INT</b></pre>
  <h4><a id="attrs"></a>Attributes</h4>
  <p>The six attributes, <i>Strength</i>, <i>Dexterity</i>, <i>Speed</i>, <i>Intelligence</i>, <i>Instinct</i>, and <i> Charisma</i>, describe the raw physical and mental capabilities of a character. Each attribute has a value typically from 0 to 20, with a score of 0 indicating a total absence of the attribute (as with someone who is dead or unconscious) while a score of 20 indicating a nearly superhuman level of aptitude. For humans, a score of ten indicates an average level of proficiency.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note: In some situations, we do not use the attribute score directly, but the <a id="modifier"></a><i>modifier</i>. The modifier for an attribute is obtained by subtracting 10 from the attribute score. An average human with 10 for all attribute scores would thus have 0 for their modifiers.</p>

  </table>
  <p>Each attribute affects multiple aspects of gameplay, meaning that players should care about which stats they prioritize and which they neglect. Not every character needs to be well-rounded, but characters with unusual ability score distributions should feel somewhat unbalanced to play.</p>
  <p>If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, your attributes are going to be determined by your racial and class bonuses. Go ahead and add up the totals and record them onto your character sheet, then move to the next section. Your attribute scores will increase later on as you level up.</p>
  <h4><a id="equipment"></a>Equipment</h4>
  <p>This section records your character's equipped weapons and armor. Magical trinkets are not recorded here, but under "inventory", even if they are currently being worn.</p>
  <h5>Weapons</h5>
  <p>To fill out this section, copy down the names and damage of the weapons you chose when you created your character. For example, let's suppose you're playing a character with a strength score of 13 and a dexterity score of 15. If you chose a longsword, you would write:</p>
  <pre>Longsword 1d12+3</pre>
  <p>The 1d12 is the die used by the weapon, while the +3 comes from your strength, because the longsword is a strength weapon. On the other hand, if you chose a katana, you would enter:</p>
  <p></p>
  <pre>Katana 1d8+5</pre>
  <p>Since the katana is a nimble weapon, you want to use whichever is higher of strength and dexterity for damage. Since 15 is higher than 13, you would use dexterity.</p>
  <p>Finally, write down whichever modifiers apply to that weapon. You can refer to <a href="appendix_weapons.html">Appendix: Weapons</a> for more information on weapons and modifiers. If you're fully familiar with your weapon's modifiers, I suggest using this space to record the abilities of any magical weapons you equip.</p>
  <p>A player can carry up to two weapons, as follows:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A single two-handed weapon</li>
   <li>A one-handed weapon, plus a buckler, shield, or small weapon in the offhand</li>
   <li>Two light weapons, such as two shortswords or two daggers</li>
   <li>A light weapon and a greatshield</li>
   <li>A one-handed weapon, with the offhand kept free to cast spells</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you only carry one weapon, leave the "offhand" column blank.</p>
  <h5>Armor</h5>
  <p>Under the "armor" section, write down the type of armor your character is wearing and the associated BC. For example, if your character is a knight you would start out wearing half plate. Therefore, you would write:</p>
  <pre>Name: Half Plate BC: 12</pre>
  <p>If you don't know the BC of your armor, you can look it up in <a href="appendix_armor.html">Appendix: Armor &amp; Materials</a></p>
  <h4><a id="skills"></a>Skills</h4>
  <p>Skills are related to attributes in that they are also used for event rolls. Every skill has an underlying supporting attribute, whose modifier is added to the roll as with an attribute check. In addition to this, players add a bonus from training called a proficiency bonus. The final value of the skill check equals the number rolled on the d20 plus the attribute modifier plus the proficency bonus, as follows:</p>
  <pre>Skill Check = 1d20 + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus</pre>
  <p>Although every skill depends on at least one attribute, several skills have a secondary supporting attribute whose modifier may be used instead, under certain circumstances. For example, a player who is sneaking may decide that they are too clumsy to move quietly and instead opt to sprint past the guard while his gaze is turned. In this case, the player is trying to use their modifier for speed instead of dexterity for the stealth check. Whether this type of substitution is allowed is situational. Certain circumstances may <i>require</i> that the alternative attribute score modifier is used, while others may allow the player to choose whichever is higher.</p>
  <p>When filling out this section, copy the <a href="#modifier">modifier</a> of the relevant attribute under the column labeled "base". Then, record your proficiency bonus (if any) under "bonus". Add the two together to calculate your total bonus for that skill. For example, if your character has a dexterity score of 13 and proficiency in <a class="tooltip"><u>accuracy</u><span>Describes a player’s accuracy with ranged weapons such as bows and firearms.</span></a>, you would fill out the entry for the accuracy skill as follows:</p>
  <pre>Base + Bonus = Total
3    + 2     = +5</pre>
  <p>Here is a list of all skills:</p>

  <p>There are five levels of proficiency in each skill. Each proficiency level has a corresponding bonus, as follows:</p>
  <table>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th>Level</th>
     <th>Roll Bonus</th>
     <th>Perks</th>
    </tr>

     <td>Can expend 3 willpower to roll with advantage. Can reroll a natural one once per skill check.</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Each of these labels indicate that the player has either undertaken training or has an especial weakness in that skill. Deficiencies can be overcome and expertise and mastery can be attained through training even after a character is made.</p>
  <p>When players obtain proficiency bonuses to the same skill from multiple sources, they do not combine to advance one’s proficiency in that skill to the next level. However, if a player acquires proficiency for the same skill from both their race and class, they may take proficiency in a new skill to replace the doubled proficiency.</p>
  <h4><a id="abilities"></a>Spells &amp; Abilities</h4>
  <p>Abilities are specific skills that confer some benefit to the player, such as spells or feats. Abilities are categorized in a few ways. First, abilities acquired from a player’s class (such as the barbarian’s rage) are called innate abilities. Abilities learned from trainers are called trained abilities, and finally trained abilities which have been fully mastered are called rote abilities. Abilities that aren't spells or innate are called feats.</p>
  <p>Abilities are also classified by whether or not they are explicitly invoked by the player or if they take effect automatically. The former are called active abilities and usually cost WP to activate, while the latter are called passive abilities (or perks) and usually take effect without the use of WP.</p>
  <p>An example of a passive ability would be a perk that restores HP at the start of the player’s turn. Since the player is not required to do anything to receive this benefit, it is passive. On the other hand, an ability that allows the player to spend WP to deal extra damage would be an active ability.</p>
  <p>In this section, write down the name of any abilities you learn, followed by the training slots used by that ability. Innate abilities don't need to go here, since they are determined by your class. If an ability is known by rote, leave the "training slots" column for that ability blank. If you're filling out a character sheet for a level one character, this section will be mostly blank except for any starting spells.</p>
  <h4><a id="backstory"></a>Backstory &amp; Personality</h4>
  <p>This section is highly unique to each character, and describes their origins, their motivations for becoming an adventurers, personal goals, as well as character strengths or flaws. There's a lot that can go here, so use your judgement and flesh out your character as much as you like.</p>
  <p>Ideally, this section should provide some explanation of your character's motives, origins, and flaws.</p>
  <h4><a id="inventory"></a>Inventory</h4>
  <p>The final aspect of your character is their inventory, which includes everything they are carrying including equipped weapons and armor. If you're filling out your character sheet for the first time, you should refer to your class choice to find your initial loadout. When you find additional items during your adventure, you'll add them here.</p>
  <p>Inventory items are categorized as weapons, gear (clothing, armor, and jewelry), tools, and consumables. All of these items are stored in your adventurer's pack. If any inventory item is equipped (such as a magic ring or amulet) you can put a star or other special mark next to it, to indicate that it is worn. There is no limit to the number of magical items you can equip, although you can't gain benefits from wearing multiple items of the same type or on the same bodypart. For example, you can't receive the bonuses from two amulets or rings at once, even if your character wears them at the same time.</p>

  </ul>
  <h4><a id="all_together"></a>Putting it all Together</h4>
  <p>Now that we've covered the various components of the character sheet, let's walk through the process of creating a character and filling out the sheet. Let's create a character named "Arnoch Strontorius":</p>
  <blockquote>
   Arnoch is a wizard, preferring to explore the application of arcane energy outside the auspices of university. He comes from a long line of adventurers, all the way back to his thrice-great grandfather, Sapio Strontorius. Back in the day, Sapio made a name for himself as a mercenary who wielded his hand-and-a-half sword and elemental magic with equal finesse. Although Arnoch has a lot to live up to, he's already shown himself as a magical prodigy. A string of family anecdotes recount his abilities, including a time when he burnt down an entire outhouse and several trees at the wee age of three, despite not having any formal training in pyromancy. Arnoch has always been enamored with flames, and fireball is his favorite spell. He says his favorite sound is the silence that comes just before a fireball (usually hurled by Arnoch himself) strikes and explodes, although the sound of dry tinder bursting into flame is a close second. His family has always encouraged him to develop his talents, and are very excited to send their little pyromaniac off on his first adventure.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   Although Arnoch's got a bit of elven ancestry from way back when, he's mainly just an old-fashioned, home-grown human raised on the family farm. (Meaning the true source of his powers remains a mystery.) Arnoch has a strong moral compass, but little regard for the law, making him unpredictable and threat to corrupt politicians. As Arnoch sets out to find his fortune, he little guesses just what he's heading into... or that he is already being watched, on account of his extraordinary powers.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now that we've established Arnoch's background, let's fill in his character sheet. First we write "Arnoch Strontorius" in the info section, followed by "wizard" as his class and "1" as his level. Below this, we write "human" and "CG" or "Chaotic Good" as his alignment.</p>
  <p>In the next section, we need Arnoch's attributes. As a human, we can choose to improve two of Arnoch's attributes by 1, by decreasing two others by 1. We'll increase his <b>INT</b> and <b>CHA</b>, at the cost of his <b>SPD</b> and <b>STR</b>. As a wizard, he gains +2 to <b>INT</b> and <b>CHA</b>. Adding these together, Arnoch's attributes are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>STR</b>: 9</li>
   <li><b>DEX</b>: 10</li>
   <li><b>SPD</b>: 9</li>
   <li><b>INT</b>: 13</li>
   <li><b>NST</b>: 10</li>
   <li><b>CHA</b>: 13</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We can now go ahead and enter these values under "Attributes", and then move on to the statistics section. At level 1, max HP is equal to Strength, so we enter "9" as his max HP. Arnoch's <b>NST</b> modifier is +0 and his <b>CHA</b> modifier is +3. We add these together and then add 10 to calculate his max willpower of 13. Finally, his intelligence of 13 means that he has 13 training slots. Since he hasn't learned any new abilities yet, his training slots are at maximum.</p>
  <p>Now let's calculate his mitigation stat. He's wearing sorcerer's robes, so his block chance is zero. Meanwhile, his dexterity is 10, which is his dodge chance. For his mitigation stat, we write:</p>
  <pre>Block + Dodge = Mitigation
0     + 10    = 10</pre>
  <p>The next sections are abilities, backstory, and equipment.</p>
