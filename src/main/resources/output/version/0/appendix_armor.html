  <h4>Armor</h4>
  <p>Many forms of armor are available for the prospective adventurer. In general, nimble and dexterous characters such as thieves and assassins prefer leather armor or brigandine. Barbarians, mercenaries, inquisitors, and most others usually make use of medium armors, such as breastplate or chainmail. Knights, veterans, and crusaders often wear splinted mail or full plate, being stouter folk.</p>

  <h4>Materials</h4>
  <p>The stats given above are for steel armor. Some armors can be upgraded to rely on tougher metals such as titanium, orichalcum, adamantine, and mithril. These give better results but are significantly more expensive.</p>
