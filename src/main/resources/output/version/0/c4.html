<hr /><p>In All That Glitters, there are three ways that characters increase their power level: leveling, training, and
  looting. The main difference between these systems is that leveling provides guaranteed and predictable bonuses, while
  looting provides more irregular and chaotic bonuses that players cannot foresee. The bonuses from leveling promote
  planning and ambition, while the bonuses from looting are unique to each adventure, and promote character identity.
  Contrasting these, training allows players to take control of their own destinies and acquire the abilities they deem
  most useful.
</p><h4><a id="leveling"></a>Leveling</h4>
<p>Each character’s skill as an adventurer is measured by their level, which typically begins at 1 and progresses up to
  20. Typically, all characters in the party level up together, usually after a huge battle or major obstacle is
  overcome. The DM increases the party's level after such milestones, recognizing the adventuring party’s increasing
  skill and renown.
</p>
<p>To level up, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look over the new class features you've gained, including any attribute or proficiency bonuses. Class features are
    covered <a href="c2.html#classes"> here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Increase your maximum hitpoints. Max HP is initially equal to your strength score and increases by half your
    strength score each level. If you leveled STR, you should recalculate your max hp:
    <pre>Max HP = Strength + (Strength * level / 2)</pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you leveled instinct or charisma, increase your maximum willpower accordingly. Max WP is equal to 10 plus your
    instinct and charisma modifiers:
    <pre>Max WP = 10 + Instinct modifier + Charisma modifier</pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you leveled Intelligence, increase your maximum training slots:
    <pre>Max Training Slots = Intelligence</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Regain training slots. Any abilities trained in previous levels now use half as many training slots, rounded down.</li>
  <li>Update your character sheet. You don't need to copy new class abilities into the "abilities" section, but you
    should make sure that your attribute values and training slots are accurate. If your attributes changed, max HP, WP,
    and skill scores may also need to be updated, since they depend on your attributes.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4><a id="training"></a>Training</h4>
<p>It is possible for characters to proactively learn certain abilities from NPC trainers, such as skill proficiencies,
  combat tactics, and spells. In addition to any gold cost, learning abilities in this way costs training slots. Each
  player has training slots equal to their intelligence score, which represent the time and mental effort required to
  fully master the new skill. Most abilities consume 2 training slots at first, but that number is reduced by half every
  time the player levels up, rounded down. After leveling up, any trained abilities that consume only one training slot
  become rote abilities, and no longer consume training slots.
</p>
<p>If a player does not have enough training slots available to learn a new ability, they cannot learn the ability even
  if they have sufficient gold to purchase the training. In this case, players can choose to forget abilities they are
  in the process of learning. If this is done, the training slots for the forgotten ability are recovered but the gold
  use to purchase the ability is lost and the skill can no longer be used.
</p>
<p>In order to learn new abilities, players must first ensure that they meet the requirements of the ability they are
  trying to learn. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many abilities require a certain level of strength or intelligence, or other attribute.</li>
  <li>Some abilities require a level of proficiency in a certain skill.</li>
  <li>High level spells often require mastery of other low level spells before they can be learned.</li>
  <li>Players must have sufficient training slots available for the ability they are trying to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming they meet these requirements, players must find and hire a trainer of the appropriate discipline and skill
  level. After this, the new ability is gained, and can be used at any point in the adventure.
</p>
<h4><a id="looting"></a>Looting</h4>
<p>True to its name, All That Glitters treats looting as a core part of the leveling process. Besides the acquisition of
  magical items, gold allows players to improve their builds in a number of important ways:
<ul>
  <li>Learning spells</li>
  <li>Hiring trainers</li>
  <li>Purchasing magical trinkets and jewelry</li>
  <li>Buying improved weapons and armor</li>
  <li>Buying potions, scrolls, or other tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Because gold is a core part of the leveling process, players can plan on obtaining a certain amount per level:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Party Level</th>
    <th>Gold per player</th>
    <th>Typical Expenditures</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0-50</td>
    <td>Basic spell and ability training</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2-3</td>
    <td>50-100</td>
    <td>Training, plus minor enchanted gadgets and consumables
    </td>
  </tr>

    <td>70-150</td>
    <td>Training, and upgrading weapons and armor.</td>

    <td>Training, including olympian attribute training.</td>

    <td>Training, and acquisition of advanced armors such as mithril or adamant.</td>

    <td>Rare and powerful trinkets and armor.</td>
  </tr>
