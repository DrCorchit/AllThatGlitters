<hr />
<p>In All That Glitters, there are three ways that characters increase their power level: leveling, training, and
	looting. The main difference between these systems is that leveling provides guaranteed and predictable bonuses,
	while looting provides more irregular and chaotic bonuses that players cannot foresee. The bonuses from leveling
	promote planning and ambition, while the bonuses from looting are unique to each adventure, and promote character
	identity. Contrasting these, training allows players to take control of their own destinies and acquire the
	abilities they deem most useful.
</p>
<h4><a id="Leveling"></a>Leveling</h4>
<p>Each character’s skill as an adventurer is measured by their level, which typically begins at 1 and progresses up to
	20. Typically, all characters in the party level up together, usually after a huge battle or major obstacle is
	overcome. The DM increases the party's level after such milestones, recognizing the adventuring party’s increasing
	skill and renown.
</p>
<p>To level up, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Increase two attribute scores by one if both are below their soft caps, or just one attribute if leveling above
		the soft cap.
	</li>
	<li>Increase your maximum HP and AP. Maximum HP is equal to thrice your level plus twice your strength, so it
		increases by at least 3. Maximum AP is equal to your level plus your willpower, so it increases by at least one.
	</li>
	<li>Regain training slots. Any abilities trained in previous levels now use half as many training slots.</li>
	<li>Review the new class features you've gained. These bonuses are covered <a href="c2.html#Choosing_a_Class">
		here</a>.
	</li>
</ol>
<h4><a id="Training_and_Training_Slots"></a>Training</h4>
<p>It is possible for characters to proactively learn certain abilities from NPC trainers, such as skill proficiencies,
	combat tactics, and spells. In addition to any gold cost, learning abilities in this way costs training slots. Each
	player has training slots equal to their intelligence score, which represent the time and mental effort required to
	fully master the new skill. Most abilities consume 2 training slots at first, but that number is reduced by half
	every time the player levels up, rounded down. After leveling up, any trained abilities that consume only one
	training slot become rote abilities, and no longer consume training slots.
</p>
<p>If a player does not have enough training slots available to learn a new ability, they cannot learn the ability even
	if they have sufficient gold to purchase the training. In this case, players can choose to forget abilities they are
	in the process of learning. If this is done, the training slots for the forgotten ability are recovered but the gold
	use to purchase the ability is lost and the skill can no longer be used.
</p>
<p>In order to learn new abilities, players must first ensure that they meet the requirements of the ability they are
	trying to learn. For example:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Many abilities require a certain level of strength or intelligence, or other attribute.</li>
	<li>Some abilities require a level of proficiency in a certain skill.</li>
	<li>High level spells often require mastery of other low level spells before they can be learned.</li>
	<li>Players must have sufficient training slots available for the ability they are trying to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming they meet these requirements, players must find and hire a trainer of the appropriate discipline and skill
	level. After this, the new ability is gained, and can be used at any point in the adventure.
</p>
<h4><a id="Looting"></a>Looting</h4>
<p>True to its name, All That Glitters treats looting as a core part of the leveling process. Besides the acquisition of
	magical items, gold allows players to improve their builds in a number of important ways:
<ul>
	<li>Learning spells</li>
	<li>Hiring trainers</li>
	<li>Purchasing magical trinkets and jewelry</li>
	<li>Buying improved weapons and armor</li>
	<li>Buying potions, scrolls, or other tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Because gold is a core part of the leveling process, players can plan on obtaining a certain amount per level:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Party Level</th>
		<th>Gold per player</th>
		<th>Typical Expenditures</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>0-50</td>
		<td>Basic spell and ability training</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2-3</td>
		<td>50-100</td>
		<td>Training, plus minor enchanted gadgets and consumables
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4-5</td>
		<td>70-150</td>
		<td>Training, and upgrading weapons and armor.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>6-7</td>
		<td>100-250</td>
		<td>Party role specialization and elite attribute training.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8-10</td>
		<td>150-300</td>
		<td>Training, including olympian attribute training.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>11-15</td>
		<td>300-500</td>
		<td>Training, and acquisition of advanced armors such as mithril or adamant.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>16+</td>
		<td>500+</td>
		<td>Rare and powerful trinkets and armor.</td>
	</tr>
