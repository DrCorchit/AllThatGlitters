<p>In gameplay terms, players practice magic by learning spells and then casting them.</p>
<h4>Learning Spells</h4>
<p>In order to learn a spell, a player must usually find a spellbook, scroll, or trainer who has knowledge of that
	specific spell. These things would normally be found in larger towns and cities, or rarely in dungeons or out in the
	wilderness. Some spells are considered common knowledge, and can be learned without a tome. Likewise, certain class
	abilities such as the Warlock's eldritch tome or the scholar's codex arcana provide special access to arcane
	knowledge.
</p>
<p>Once an appropriate trainer or tome has been located, the player may have to meet certain requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A certain level of an attribute</li>
	<li>Proficiency in a certain skill</li>
	<li>Mastery of prerequisite spells</li>
	<li>A certain number of training slots</li>
	<li>A required sum of gold</li>
</ul>
<p>Each spell lists its specific requirements in its description. Once all these requirements are met, the player learns
	the spell. The spell can only be unlearned if the player intentionally forgets it, usually in order to free up
	training slots.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px">
	Note that some types of spells are exceptionally difficult to learn. In particular, unethical forms of magic such as
	necromancy or demonolatry are not taught at respectable institutions (at least, not if they want to retain their
	reputation). If you want to learn these spells, you might have to get your hands dirty.
</p>
<h4>Casting Spells</h4>
<p>Once a spell has been learned, certain additional requirements must be met in order to cast the spell. These
	requirements are unique to each spell, and detailed in the spell description. In general, most spells expend AP and
	require a main hand action to cast. However, some spells require two hands, while others can be cast with the
	offhand. Spell requirements are often related to how the spell is cast, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Burst Spells</b>: Spells which can be cast quickly and take effect instantaneously. Casting the spell incurs
		a one-time expenditure of AP. Most of these are versatile spells with few material or circumstantial
		requirements.
	</li>
	<li><b>Concentration Spells</b>: Spells which are cast over a span of time. These spells usually require a burst of
		AP to initiate the spell and a smaller amount to maintain it. Concentration can be broken if the caster is
		damaged or distracted.
	</li>
	<li><b>Rituals</b>: Spells that require careful and methodic preparation. These spells are not normally cast during
		combat, but usually offer a better tradeoff of AP versus power. Rituals ofteno require specific circumstances,
		such as certain weather conditions, positioning of the moon or stars, or access to a consecrated altar.
	</li>
	<li><b>Ceremonies</b>: Ceremonies are complex rituals that require more AP than is available to a single character.
		During a ceremony, each participant contributes some energy towards the casting of the spell. Like rituals,
		these spells often have special requirements.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Categorizing spells</h4>
<p>Despite being intensely studied, magic remains an abstruse and opaque subject. Among those who study it, there is no
	consensus as to why certain individuals wield its power so effortlessly, why certain spells are so difficult to
	reproduce, and why other spells work at all. This inconvenience doesn't stop scholars from doing the one thing they
	are truly good at, however: categorizing things.
</p>
<blockquote>Any sensible treatise on magic will disclose the following insight: <i>magic is energy</i>. Therefore, magic
	is classified according to whence this energy originates, the techniques used to manipulate it, and finally
	according to the overall purpose of its application. In fact, all spells follow the same basic pattern, whereby the
	magus identifies a source of energy, imposes order over chaos, and finally unleashes this directed energy upon the
	world. These stages are formally known as sorcery, concentration, and evocation.
	<p style="text-align: right;">— Albrecht Riftenvorg, <i>A Primer on Magic</i></p>
</blockquote>

Damage, Healing, Psychic, Summon, Physical


<p>In general, charismatic characters excel at sorcery, intelligent characters excel at concentration, and willful
	characters excel at evocation. Although all spells involve all three of these stages, they do not rely on them
	equally. For example, casting fireball requires some skill at sorcery and a great deal of willpower, but very little
	concentration. Likewise, divination spells usually require a great deal of concentration, but little evocation.
</p>
<p>At the most basic level, the three types of spells are <i>divination</i>, <i>conjuration</i>, and <i>evocation</i>.
	Divination magic is concerned with information, whether collecting, transmitting, or fabricating it. Conjuration
	deals with spirits, whether they are summoned, bound, or banished. Finally, evocation deals with the disposition of
	energy, applying it for creation, preservation, transformation, or destruction. Each of these types are further
	subdivided and studied under various magical schools. In theory, schools ending in -mancy indicate divination while
	those ending in -urgy indicate evocation. In practice, commonfolk tend not to appreciate this distinction and make
	quite a mess of things. For example, there was once a distinction between necromancy and necromurgy; the former was
	concerned with contacting deceased spirits, while the latter was concerned with raising their bodies. However, the
	latter term has become practically obsolete, leaving the term "necromancy" to describe any form of death-related
	magic, divination or otherwise.
</p>
<p>To further muddy the waters, modern magic often employs "hybrid" spells incorporating aspects of various schools of
	magic. For example, the spell <i>Nystaff's magical orchestra</i> summons an entire troop of fey musicians who
</p>
<p>Scholars categorize magic primarily according to its source. Part of the reason they do so is certain sources of
	magic are considered inherently unethical. In general, two types of magic are considered unethical:
	<i>demonolatry</i> (conjuration of demons), and <i>necromancy</i> (harvesting of souls, and raising of the dead).
	All else is fair game.
</p>
<p>Here are the most common sources of magic:</p>
<h4>Human Magic</h4>
<p>The most common type of magic involves channeling one's own life essence as a source of power for spells. Often
	called <i>anthurgy</i> or <i>auturgy</i>, this form of magic does not draw
</p>
<h4></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Viviurgy, the working of the lifeforce
		<p>
			Viviurgy is the most basic form of magic. Even when not used directly, it is often used to initiate spells
			from other schools. The most common variation of viviurgy involves a mage channeling his or her own life
			force in a practice called egomancy. This form of magic is extremely versatile because the entire process is
			self-contained. The downside of this practice is that its power is limited and overuse leads to exhaustion
			(and in rare cases, death) of the practitioner. Another downside is that it is difficult to use for
			divination, since it reaches inward rather than outward.
		</p>
		<p>In addition to auturgy, viviurgy also encompasses pair magic and ceremonial magic. In pair magic, one mage
			essentially becomes a living battery, acting as a source for the other's magic. In ceremonial magic, an
			assembly of participants works their magic in concert, harmonizing their power towards a shared goal.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Conjuration, the summoning or consultation of spirits
		<p>
			Conjuration magic is categorized according to the type of spirit summoned, and the method used to summon.
			The upside of this form of magic is that the summoned spirits tend to wield greater power than a human can
			on their own. Most spirits rather enjoy being summoned, as the physical world is seen as fairly exciting and
			chaotic. Therefore, they usually make a reasonable attempt to fulfill the summoner's bidding, in hopes of
			being summoned again. However, having their own free will, spirits (especially fey) can behave
			unpredictably. In general, a supplication spell summons a spirit willingly, while a binding spell summons
			and restrains a spirit unwillingly. The latter practice is widely considered unethical.
		</p>
		<p>
			A proper discussion of conjuration requires knowledge of the four types of greater spirits: angels, demons,
			fey, and dragons, corresponding to the elements of air, earth, water, and fire, and the compass directions
			of north, south, east, and west, respectively. Thus, the art of conjuration is categorized into
			draconolatry, demonolatry, fey worship, and supplication.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Necromancy, the magic of the dead.
		<p>
			All spells from this school of magic are strictly forbidden in nearly every corner of the world. In general,
			there are two forms of necromancy: leaching and raising. Leaching draws energy from the spirits of the dead,
			while raising forces energy back in.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Astrology, the magic of the spheres</li>
	<li>Geomancy, the magic of nature
		<p>Animals vs Plants</p>
	</li>
	<li>Pragomancy, the magic of physical objects

			Pragomancy is capacitation, transduction, obliteration
