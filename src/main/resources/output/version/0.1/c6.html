<p>Although much of the action outside of combat is fairly open-ended, there are specific rules for certain actions:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#Resting">Resting</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Travel">Travel</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Swimming">Swimming</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Sneaking">Sneaking</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Pickpocket">Pickpocket</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Lockpicking">Lockpicking</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Haggling">Haggling</a></li>
</ol>
<h4><a id="Resting"></a>Resting</h4>
<p>Over time, your characters become ragged and weary as they take damage and expend AP during combat. Although some HP
	and AP can be recovered with potions or abilities, most recovery is done through resting. There are two kinds of
	rests:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Long Rest</b>: The entire party makes camp and sleeps for 8 hours, completing the adventuring day. If in the
		wilderness, this typically involves setting up camp, building a fire, cooking dinner, and so forth. In villages
		and towns, it usually involves a night at an inn. All HP and AP are fully restored. It's not possible to long
		rest inside certain areas, such as a fortress controlled by the enemy, or a hostile wilderness or dungeon.
	</li>
	<li><b>Short Rest</b>: The party sits down for an hour or so to dress their wounds and catch their breath. Each
		player recovers one third of their missing HP and AP. The party can short rest at most twice between long rests.
	</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Travel"></a>Traveling</h4>
<p>When traveling long distance overland, there are a number of concerns: food, water, bandits, weather, and road
	quality. Of these, food and bandits are the most troublesome.
</p>
<h5>Food</h5>
<p>The basic unit of food is the day's ration. Rations are presumed to consist of nonperishable supplies such as salted
	meat, pickled vegetables, or hardtack. Each adventurer consumes one ration per day. When rations run out, the party
	is either forced to hunt, which halves travel speed, or begins starvation.
</p>
<p>Starvation has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
	<li>After day 3, the party can no longer recover during short rests.</li>
	<li>After day 5, the effect of a long rest is reduced to that of a short rest.</li>
	<li>After day 7, the party can no longer take rests. Skill checks are made with disadvantage.</li>
	<li>Starting on the 14th day, all attributes except speed are reduced by 1 each day. When strength reaches zero, the
		character perishes of hunger.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of starvation linger even after consuming rations. In the wilderness, characters recover 1 day of hunger
	every day they consume rations. In villages and towns, 3 days of hunger are recovered per day. It takes
	approximately one week to fully recover from the brink of starvation.
</p>
<h5>Bandits</h5>
<p>Bandits usually set up ambushes along minor trade routes and between cities, but shy away from the cities themselves
	and heavily travelled routes. Similarly, pirates roam the seas usually along trade routes. Naturally, all forms of
	banditry increase during wartime. Bandits and pirates behave differently depending on their class. Yokels and
	simpleton bandits usually kill their prey outright and loot their pockets. Professional bandits usually investigate
	their victims and attempt to discern if there is any chance of ransom. Pirates tend to sell their victims as slaves
	in foreign markets, while privateers tend to seek ransom.
</p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules for bandit encounters, but a rough understanding of their methods and techniques
	lends historical accuracy to the campaign.
</p>
<h4><a id="Swimming"></a>Swimming</h4>
<p>Whether above or under the water, movement speed is reduced by one half when swimming. So, a character with a speed
	score of 10 that normally moves at 5 ft/s would swim at 2.5 ft/s. It's possible to train swimming speed (Athletics
	Training: Freestyle), to bring swimming up to walking speed.
</p>
<p>Underwater, players can normally hold their breath for 10 seconds per point invested in the strength attribute, after
	which point they must pass a DT 10 willpower saving throw every ten seconds to avoid drowning. As with
	swimming speed, this can be improved with training (Athletics Training: Lung Capacity). The same rules apply when
	holding one's breath for other reasons, such as trying to avoid inhaling toxic fumes.
</p>
<h4><a id="Sneaking"></a>Sneaking</h4>
<p>Sneaking is handled as an ability check. The DT is 5 under near-ideal conditions (night, light background noise, not
	actively sought.) However, the following conditions affect the DT:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dim Lighting: +5 to the DT</li>
	<li>Bright Lighting: +10 to the DT</li>
	<li>Absolute Silence: +3 to the DT</li>
	<li>Heavy background noise: -3 to the DT</li>
	<li>Obscuring fog or smoke, or partial cover (such as a crowd): -5 to the DT</li>
	<li>Actively sought: The seeker's willpower ASM and perception proficiency are added to the DT.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, the DM may make additional adjustments as necessary.</p>
<h4><a id="Pickpocket"></a>Pickpocket</h4>
<p>Pickpocketing is a risky but potentially rewarding endeavor. To pickpocket, you roll for sleight-of-hand, while your
	mark (controlled by the DM) rolls for perception. If your roll is higher than the mark's role, you successfully pick
	their pocket. Otherwise, they catch you with your hand in their pocket and act accordingly.
</p>
<p>There are special rules in certain occasions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the mark is in the middle of a crowd, engaged in deep conversation, or similarly distracted they have
		disadvantage on the perception roll.
	</li>
	<li>If the mark has their hands in their pockets, they have advantage on the perception roll.</li>
	<li>If you are intoxicated or one of your hands is restrained, you have disadvantage on the sleight of hand roll.
	</li>
	<li>If the city or location has a criminal reputation, the DT of the sleight of hand check is increased by 1d6.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>When pickpocketing, different types of citizens usually have different amounts of money:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Class</th>
		<th>Gold</th>
		<th>Typical Items</th>
		<th>Typical Response</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Beggars &amp; Paupers</td>
		<td>1d4</td>
		<td>Shivs or lockpicks.</td>
		<td>Cuss you out furiously</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Peasants &amp; Laborers</td>
		<td>1d12</td>
		<td>Small weapons, Junk (nails, string, buttons, etc)</td>
		<td>Roll a 1d10:
			<p style="margin-left: 25px">
				1: Cuss you out <br/>2-6: Call the guards <br/>7-9: Instigate a fight <br/>10: Silently report to the
				syndicate
			</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Merchants, Yeomen, Scribes &amp; Scholars</td>
		<td>2d20</td>
		<td>Health potions, low level scrolls and spell tomes, junk (quills, inkpots, paper).</td>
		<td>Call the guards</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Nobles &amp; Regents</td>
		<td>1d100</td>
		<td>High level potions, jewels, (possibly enchanted) jewelry</td>
		<td>Call the guards, or silently hire syndicate hitmen.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h4><a id="Lockpicking"></a>Lockpicking</h4>
<p>Lockpicking is fairly straightforward. To pick a lock, you must have at least one lockpick in your inventory. You the
	roll a sleight-of-hand check against the DT of the lock. If successful, the lock is opened. If it fails, the
	lockpick is lost, but you may continue attempting to pick the lock if you have additional lockpicks.
</p>
<p>Some special rules apply:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If a guard is watching, you may have to roll for stealth while picking the lock. If you fail the stealth roll,
		you can continue picking the lock, but will have to deal with the consequences as the guard will notice your
		lawless behavior.
	</li>
	<li>If a lock is of an unusual make, the pick can break inside the lock rendering the lock unpickable. The DM should
		notify the player beforehand if this is likely to occur. The lockpick breaking inside the lock may also happen
		on a critical failure.
	</li>
	<li>Some locks may require two picks to be used at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Haggling"></a>Haggling</h4>
<p>Players can attempt to haggle merchants using the persuasion skill. A merchant can be haggled up to three times,
	offering successively larger discounts if the player is able to pass successively higher DT persuasion checks. If
	the player fails any haggle, the merchant becomes obstinate and the discount for that item cannot be increased
	further. If the player fails to surpass DT 10 on any haggle, the merchant becomes irritated and removes all
	discounts completely.
</p>
<p>After attempting to haggle a merchant, the same merchant will not allow themselves to be haggled again for some time,
	unless they are fond of the adventuring party or from a culture where haggling is expected. The DM may impose
	situational bonuses or penalties to haggling accordingly.
</p>

		<th>DT</th>
		<th>Price Reduction</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>15</td>
		<td>15%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>20</td>
		<td>25%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
