<hr />
<p>A player can carry up to two weapons, as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A single greatweapon, carried in a two-handed grip</li>
	<li>A standard weapon and a shield</li>
	<li>A standard weapon, plus a small weapon in the offhand</li>
	<li>Two light weapons, such as two shortswords or two rapiers</li>
	<li>Two small weapons, such as two daggers </li>
	<li>A standard weapon, with the offhand kept free in order to cast spells</li>
	<li>A small weapon, with the main hand kept free in order to cast more powerful spells</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain weapons have special properties, which affect how they behave:
<ul>
	<li><b>Piercing</b>: The weapon deals piercing damage only.</li>
	<li><b>Slashing</b>: The weapon deals slashing damage only.</li>
	<li><b>Bludgeoning</b>: The weapon deals bludgeoning damage only.</li>
	<li><b>Cut-and-Thrust</b>: The item can deal either piercing or slashing damage.</li>
	<li><b>Parrying</b>: The weapon allows parrying, increasing parry chance for the weapon by the indicated amount.
	</li>
	<li><b>Blocking</b>: The weapon increases BC by a certain amount when blocking.</li>
	<li><b>Mordhau</b>: The weapon can be held in a reversed grip to change the damage type to bludgeoning. This
		changes the weapon’s damage die. (Larger swords have this property.)</li>
	<li><b>Versatile</b>: The weapon can be held in a two-handed grip for extra damage.</li>
	<li><b>Nimble</b>: Dexterity can be used to augment the weapon’s damage, instead of strength.</li>
	<li><b>Improvised</b>: The item is not designed as a weapon. The damage die is rolled with disadvantage.</li>
	<li><b>Light</b>: The weapon can be dual-wielded, alongside another light weapon. Of a ranged weapon, indicates
		that the weapon can be fired with one hand. (All small weapons have this property.)</li>
	<li><b>Sharp</b>: The critical threshold for the weapon is reduced by 1.</li>
	<li><b>Reach</b>: The weapon can hit targets 10 feet away, instead of 5.</li>
	<li><b>Throwable</b>: In addition to regular use, the weapon can be effectively thrown.</li>
	<li><b>Thrown</b>: The weapon is <i>only</i>thrown, and never retained in the hand.</li>
	<li><b>Projectile</b>: The weapon fires a specific type of projectile.</li>
	<li><b>Loading</b>: Once discharged, the weapon must be loaded again to be re-used. Loading such a weapon takes a
		full main hand action. The weapon’s damage is also not affected by any attributes of the bearer, such as
		strength or dexterity.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Small Weapons</h5>
<p>Such weapons are those which are easily wielded in one hand, including small everyday tools improvised as weapons.
	They require no especial skill to use, are easily concealed, and are typically wielded by civilians. These weapons
	automatically have the light property, and can be dual-wielded or used in the offhand.</p>

	weapons, drawn bows, crossbows, and firearms. Thrown weapons

	DEX to hit (never STR). Crossbows and gunpowder weapons do a flat damage amount unrelated to the attributes of the
	wielder.</p>
